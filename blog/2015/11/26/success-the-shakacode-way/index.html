<div class="entry-content"><p><em>Republished from <a href="http://www.shakacode.com/2015/11/26/success-the-shakacode-way.html">www.shakacode.com</a></em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Thanksgiving today! I&rsquo;m taking a few minutes to put down a few thoughts
that I hope will bring you, your family, and your friends &ldquo;success&rdquo; in the
coming year.</p>

<p>Success is ambiguous. Is it
<a href="https://medium.com/@dhh/the-day-i-became-a-millionaire-55d7dc4d8293#.80b2anf29">being a millionaire</a>?
Being famous?
<a href="https://medium.com/@dhh/i-don-t-want-to-be-a-winner-9858d0c32fa0#.7mwrh5asb">Winning competitions</a>?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s happiness! This image captures <em>part</em> of my definition of
success. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jimmie.hepp2?fref=ts">Jimmie Hepp</a> took
this picture just a couple days before I wrote this article.</p>

<p><img src="/images/shakacode-blog/justin-surfing-offshore-winds-smiling.jpg"></p>

<p>Note, I said happiness is just a <em>part</em> of success. Balance in life is key to
success. While I have the means to spend all my time surfing, I&rsquo;d find greater
happiness in striking a balance with my other passion, which is creating great
software and an organization called &ldquo;ShakaCode&rdquo;. ShakaCode is more than just a
company; it&rsquo;s a community. A large part of what
<a href="http://www.shakacode.com">ShakaCode</a> does is giving away <strong>free</strong> code and
training to world&rsquo;s software community, as shown by our
<a href="http://www.shakacode.com/opensource/">open source projects</a>, our
<a href="http://forum.shakacode.com/">ShakaCode forum</a>, and my
<a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com">RailsOnMaui blog</a>.</p>

<p>A big part of the DNA of ShakaCode is that we&rsquo;re
<strong><a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/remote-or-co-located.html">remote first</a></strong>.
This means that <em>you</em> can be involved with ShakaCode regardless of just about
any factor other than having a decent computer, good Internet, and a true
passion to learn and contribute. And if you have family duties, just hate time
wasted commuting, or want to live at a ski resort or a remote surf break &ndash;
that&rsquo;s all OK. Educational background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, age, etc.
all do not matter to us. All of our team members share this philosophy and this
is how we <a href="http://www.shakacode.com/about/#work-with-us">find new team members</a>.</p>

<h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>

<p>One of my first hires, Dylan, exemplifies ShakaCode&rsquo;s values.</p>

<p>After coming out of high school on Maui, surfing was valued more than anything
academic. Rather than attending college, Dylan got a job and focused most of his
energies on fun outdoor activities in Maui such as surfing, kite surfing, and
mountain biking. Dylan soon discovered his job required a college degree for
promotion. At community college, Dylan quickly discovered he <strong>LOVED</strong>
computers! After college, Dylan pursued a successful career in support and
management of computer systems and networks.</p>

<p>However, this did not satisfy Dylan&rsquo;s insatiable thirst and passion for
technology. He told me that he could see that much of his job would be automated
by software, so he had better learn to code!</p>

<p>Over many years, I&rsquo;ve offered to share my love for computer programming with
friends, telling them that it&rsquo;s the best job ever for a surfer in that you can
be anywhere in the world and have a productive career. While I&rsquo;ve had a few
friends that showed interest, <strong>none</strong> of them had the <strong>passion</strong> and
<strong>desire</strong> of Dylan.</p>

<p>Dylan would show up every day at my office and just soak up everything I could
give him. When he wasn&rsquo;t in my office, he&rsquo;d have his iPhone set to technology
podcasts all day long. Eventually, I tell Dylan to quit his current job, and to
join me full-time! I can tell you with 100% certainty that this was one of the
best decisions I&rsquo;ve ever made!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s bounce back to the topic of &ldquo;success the ShakaCode way.&rdquo; If you can find
some passion of yours that you can contribute to the world, and you can balance
that with a healthy lifestyle, that is success. However, like replicating
startup company success, this might seem inaccessible, especially to those that
are not computer fanatics like the ShakaCode team.</p>

<h2>(Winning) Competition Is Not Success</h2>

<p>Americans love competition. It&rsquo;s everywhere: in sports, in business, and in
academics. We cherish the winners and berate the losers. And this mentality is
counterproductive to success in your career and overall happiness! In the last
few months, a couple heroes of mine, David Heinemeier Hanson and Laird Hamilton,
have shared their perspectives on competition. Their advice correlates with my
view that <em>collaboration and creativity</em> will do more for your success than a
stressful focus on competition.</p>

<p><img src="/images/shakacode-blog/lemans2013.jpg"></p>

<p>To quote <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/">David Heinemeier Hanson</a> in
<a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3977-i-dont-want-to-be-a-winner">I don&rsquo;t want to be a winner</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Is there anything our society exalts more than The Winner? That fiery someone
who crushes all competition to stand alone and victorious at the end. A
genetic predisposition, I’m sure.</p>

<p>The paradigm of competition is so ingrained as the basic business narrative
that we usually don’t even recognize it, much less question it. Well, of
course there are winners and losers! What are you, a f****** communist?!</p></blockquote>

<p>Instead of focusing on &ldquo;winning,&rdquo; focus on creativity, collaboration, and
giving. If your definition of &ldquo;winning&rdquo; <em>is</em> &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; and possibly material
riches, then the path is not by <em>defeating</em> others, but, instead, by <em>helping</em>
others! While I cannot speak to every industry, in the world of open source
software, based on my experience, helping others is definitely the path to
success!</p>

<p>While this topic applies to individuals, as well as businesses, it&rsquo;s <strong>probably
most important for our youth</strong> and their hyper-competitive parents. The
importance of winning, sadly, starts off early for most youngsters. On the
playground, kids play sports to &ldquo;win&rdquo;. Have you ever seen hyper-competitive
little league parents? &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not a winner, then you&rsquo;re a <strong>LOSER</strong>!</p>

<p>In high school, you have to beat your peers to get the best grades, and then
have to beat them on college entrance exams to get into the right university.
Winning jocks are idolized. This continues into college, where you have to
compete for grades, jobs, and seemingly just about anything.</p>

<p>This recent, detailed article,
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/12/the-silicon-valley-suicides/413140/">The Silicon Valley Suicides: Why are so many kids with bright prospects killing themselves in Palo Alto?</a>,
highlights dangers of hyper-competitive parenting. Here&rsquo;s a quote that describes
the pressure at these high achieving high schools:</p>

<blockquote><p>Heavy stress among “good kids” was the product of “a nasty competitive
atmosphere contrived by unethical Tiger Mothers,” one commenter wrote. At the
end of some of my conversations, a student, teacher, or counselor would look
around to make sure no one was listening and then whisper a story about an
Asian kid being punished or even kicked out of the house for a night after
getting a B or failing to get into Stanford.</p></blockquote>

<p>A Palo Alto student, Carolyn Walworth, gave the youth perspective:</p>

<blockquote><p>“A piece of you cringes when you hear that your friend has been preparing for
the SAT with classes since last summer, and that they’re already scoring a
2000, (And what about … the girl taking a summer immersion program to skip ahead and
get into AP French her sophomore year? And that internship your best friend
has with a Stanford professor?) You can’t help but slip into the system of
competitive insanity … We are not teenagers. We are lifeless bodies in a
system that breeds competition, hatred, and discourages teamwork and genuine
learning. We lack sincere passion. We are sick … Why is that not getting
through to this community? Why does this insanity that is our school district
continue?&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The college grad may then go into corporate America and learn the meaning of
&ldquo;Stack Ranking&rdquo;, as portrayed
<a href="http://qz.com/320532/marissa-mayers-yahoo-is-a-case-study-in-the-toxic-nature-of-stack-ranking/">at Yahoo</a>.
I&rsquo;ve personally worked for a company where the managers of a division could only
award a single &ldquo;1&rdquo; performance ranking, regardless of how many excellent
achievers were in the group. At the same time, these managers were forced to
award &ldquo;3&rsquo;s&rdquo;. &ldquo;1&rdquo; means amazing, and &ldquo;3&rdquo; means you&rsquo;re being given a &ldquo;performance
plan&rdquo;, which really means &ldquo;we&rsquo;re firing you and we don&rsquo;t want you to sue us.&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s probably not surprising that this same stack-ranking company also deterred
open source contributions. At this company, contributing to any open source
project without 3 levels of management approval was grounds for firing! <em>Tip:
don&rsquo;t work for such companies.</em></p>

<h2>Compete Against Yourself Only</h2>

<p><img src="/images/shakacode-blog/Laird_Hamilton_Teahupoo_2000.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird_Hamilton">Laird</a> is as much a legend in the
surfing world as David is in the programming and startup worlds. He could have
competed in professional surfing. Instead, he chose to forge his own path,
rather than being bound by the judging standards of competitive surfing. In a
recent interview in the
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/laird-hamilton-competition_55d4fe27e4b055a6dab2d7b5">Huffington Post</a>,
he stated:</p>

<p>While Laird is all about surfing, his comments also apply to the world of <strong>open
source collaboration</strong>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“A creative man is fulfilled by accomplishments and a competitive man is
fulfilled by beating others,&ldquo; Hamilton said, paraphrasing an old saying. He
continued, &#8220;I’m all about accomplishments. Ride the biggest wave. It has to do
with me. I can always grow and keep accomplishing things.”</p>

<p>This insistence on competing only with himself is a survival mechanism of
sorts &ndash; or an almost spiritual life philosophy. “I wanted to be in control. I
wanted to be the one determining if I felt fulfilled or not,” Hamilton said.
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/laird-hamilton-competition_55d4fe27e4b055a6dab2d7b5">Source: Huffington Post</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While Laird and Justin surf, David races cars:</p>

<blockquote><p>The only competition I’ve come to love is the one against myself, and that’s
not really a competition, now is it? The progress of betterment. Playing your
part to the best of your abilities in a beautiful whole.</p>

<p>That’s the joy I take away from racing cars for endurance. It’s not so much
being faster than the other cars, but striving to perfect your own
contribution as part of a team. Pushing against the limits of perfect
execution over the long term. 24 hours of testing your capability to avoid
mistake and fatigue. Winning is almost incidental to that.</p></blockquote>

<p>For me, the joy of surfing is to compete with myself. The primary goal is to
become <strong>connected to the energy of the ocean</strong>. It challenges you both at the
physical and mental levels, as you need strength and agility to ride waves. It
also challenges your judgment. Can you predict where the next wave will break?
Are you the surfer best positioned for the next wave? What I love the most about
surfing is the feeling that the learning process never ends. This combination of
applying strength and skill also applies to other outdoor action sports such as snow
boarding, mountain biking, kite-surfing, windsurfing, paddling, etc. For myself
and many others, healthy outdoor exercise fosters great creativity at work.</p>

<h2>Success the ShakaCode Way</h2>

<p>What works for Laird, David, and me, regarding happiness, is to focus on
<strong>creative expression</strong>, be it in the waves, in writing, in software, or
wherever your passion lies. Forget about competition and beating others.
Instead, focus on what you can do to help and inspire others! We have to
focus on making bigger pies, and not getting just larger slices of a fixed pie,
as in &ldquo;winners&rdquo; and &ldquo;losers.&rdquo; Open source is all about this &ldquo;grow the pie
collaboration,&rdquo; in sharp contrast to the litigation brought on by patents and
copyrights.</p>

<p>At ShakaCode, there&rsquo;s no good or bad or code. Through constant collaboration and
peer review, without fears of criticism or &ldquo;looking dumb,&rdquo; we as a team deliver
the best possible product, and we all improve our skills on a daily basis.
Everything we do is based on open source, and we&rsquo;re doing our best to make
meaningful contributions to the community, such as our new Ruby Gem,
<a href="https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails">react_on_rails</a>.</p>

<p>Our hiring reflects our philosophy. We don&rsquo;t torture job candidates with
programming stress tests. Instead, we try to work with them on open source just
as we would after they are hired. This fits into our <strong>remote first</strong>
philosophy. Basically, if you can contribute meaningfully to open source in the
Ruby and JavaScript worlds, then you&rsquo;ll fit right in with us, regardless of
where you&rsquo;re located or whether or not you can solve humiliating programming
puzzles in record time. We don&rsquo;t monitor our team members. Instead we trust them
to make the right decisions and to act with integrity.</p>

<p>By the way, at ShakaCode, we&rsquo;re thrilled our team members have hobbies like
surfing to complement the intellectual vigor of writing code. Our business is a
marathon, not a sprint, and a healthy, long-term perspective is best for our
team, our clients, and our products. And a flexible, remote-first work
environment is conducive to allowing our team members to live well balanced and
productive lives.</p>

<p>For a more detailed perspective on the <a href="http://www.shakacode.com/">ShakaCode&rsquo;s</a>
philosophy, see <a href="/2015/09/17/who-is-shaka-code.html">Who Is ShakaCode?</a></p>
