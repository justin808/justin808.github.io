    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Woo hoo! I&#8217;m going to the <a href="http://gogaruco.com/">2014 Golden Gate Ruby Conference</a>. I wrote an article
about my experience last year, <a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/09/22/gogaruco-2013/">GoGaRuCo 2013: Community &gt; Code</a>. If you&#8217;re on the
fence, here&#8217;s my top reasons on why you should consider attending. I recommend
not delaying <a href="http://gogaruco.com/registration/">signing up</a>, as last year I saw folks begging for tickets once the
conference sold out.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Top 10 Reasons To Attend GoGaRuCo</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>San Francisco is a great town to visit, and there&#8217;s no better month to visit
than September as dense fog is least likely!
</li>
<li>It&#8217;s relatively small conference, compared to Rails Conf, and I find that
<b>much more engaging and relaxing</b>. The attendees seem to be a mix of highly
passionate Rubyists, mostly locals, with a mix from around the world.
</li>
<li>A one track conference is nice in that you don&#8217;t have to worry about picking
which talks to attend.
</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a 15 minute break between each talk to socialize with fellow
attendees or speakers. Socializing is why you come to these talks!
</li>
<li>Yehuda will likely come up with some interesting talk!
</li>
<li>Ruby programming is really more of an art and passion than work, and the
people that attend GoGaRuCo reflect this!
</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll probably make a few new friends and leave inspired.
</li>
<li>The food is super, both at the conference and throughout the city. And the
evening events last year were great as well.
</li>
<li>There&#8217;s probably going to be a job board, just in case that interests you.
</li>
<li>You won&#8217;t need any more T-shirts for another year!
</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Photography</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I&#8217;m volunteering as the official photographer of GoGaRuCo. My mission is to &#8220;get
2-3 good shots of each speaker, a couple of audience shots during each days
lunch and breaks, a shot or two of each exhibitor table, 2-3 team photos, and a
smattering of everything else.&#8221; So please don&#8217;t be shy and ask to have your
photograph taken.
</p>

<p>
Here&#8217;s a sample of shots I took at GoGaRuCo 2013. Tons more photos are linked

If you&#8217;d like to meet me around the time of GoGaRuCo, don&#8217;t hesitate to email me
to try to meet up in person. Possibly you might have a project that could use my
help?
</p>

<p>
On a personal note, I spent the better part of my adult-hood in San Francisco,
so I&#8217;ve got tons of friends there. All my consulting clients tend to be from the
Bay Area as well.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
I had the opportunity to spend the entire workday remote pair programming from
my office in Maui with a San Francisco client from <a href="http://www.cloudcity.io/">Cloud City Development</a>. We
used our normal tools of <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a>, Chrome, and iTerm2 on a 27&#8221; Cinema Display
shared via <a href="http://screenhero.com/">Screenhero</a>. While remote will probably never be 100% as good as true
in-person pairing, it&#8217;s getting very close! Here&#8217;s some tips for effective
remote pair programming. Scroll down to the bottom for the TLDR if you&#8217;re short
on time. Overall, I would highly recommend remote pairing with RubyMine on a
full 27&#8221; Cinema Display, using an iPad with a Google Hangout for eye contact!
</p>

<p>
Here&#8217;s a very detailed video of how to do remote collaboration:
</p>

<p>
<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FkDhVrFgZAQ "></iframe></div>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Telepresence Using Video Chat on iPad</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Per the recommendation of <a href="https://twitter.com/timocratic">Tim Connor</a> of <a href="http://www.cloudcity.io/">Cloud City Development</a>, I started using
an iPad for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepresence">telepresence</a> for <b>only the video</b>, using <b><a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/">Google Hangouts</a></b>, muting
the microphone on the Hangout, and using the audio on <a href="http://screenhero.com/">Screenhero</a>. While one can
run Google Hangouts on the laptop, it can really suck up the CPU. Note, an
iPhone or probably an Android phone or table would work equally as well. In
terms of the audio, the microphone and speakers are better on the computer. If
one is using the laptop for the telepresence video, and using multiple screens,
it&#8217;s key to use the camera on the screen where one will be looking at the
Hangout, and not at the Screenhero screen. As shown from the below pictures,
it&#8217;s key that it&#8217;s obvious when the pairing partners are looking at each other
versus at Screenhero. Incidentally, Screenhero did not suffer from any
degradation when combined with the Google Hangout, regardless of using the
Hangout on the laptop or mobile device.

<h2 id="sec-2">Screenhero</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
We both used <a href="http://screenhero.com/">Screenhero</a> on Macs. I&#8217;ve done plenty of remote pair programming
using Google Hangouts, but typically only one person sharing the screen drives
the code. Screenhero allows true screen sharing such that both programmers can
do the typing and mousing. With the shared screen being a 27&#8221; Cinema display, I
set my Screenhero window to <i>full screen</i> and the resolution was nearly perfect.
Yes, when scrolling and switching apps, there is a slight delay, but it was
extremely manageable to the point that I almost would forget that I&#8217;m working on
a computer 3000 miles away. Although there&#8217;s a slight slowness in seeing keys
that you type, it&#8217;s minor enough that it&#8217;s not a nuisance. The dual cursor
support works great. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BojQaD64GU">video demo of the dual cursor support</a>.

<h2 id="sec-3">RubyMine IDE</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Both I and my pairing partners were already using <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a>, so using RubyMine
was a natural choice over trying to pair with the conventional remote pairing
setup of tmux and Vim. RubyMine combined with Screenhero, the same size big
screens, fast computers, and very good broadband resulted in a productive
pairing setup. One thing I hear about Vim setups is that pair programmers tend
to not customize their Vim keymaps. With RubyMine, that&#8217;s not an issue thanks to
a feature called &#8220;Quick Switch Scheme&#8221; which allows very fast switching of
keyboard bindings. I&#8217;m a Vim user (IdeaVim), and I would have been crippled
without my favorite RubyMine Vim bindings. I like the &#8220;Quick Switch&#8221; feature so
much that I made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57xOTXF78w&noredirect=1">a short screencast on this feature</a>, displayed below.

<h2 id="sec-4">Fast Broadband</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
I use a combination of the fastest cable and the fastest DSL I can buy in Maui,
served on a load-balancing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ZyXEL-Internet-Security-Firewall-Dual-WAN/dp/B0042WCFI2">ZyXEL ZyWall USG 50 Router</a>. DSL is far slower than
the cable service, but I still keep it for the one day that cable is not working
right. As an additional backup, I have a Verizon LTE tethering plan for my
iPhone 5, so the chances that I&#8217;m totally out of Internet are low. Here&#8217;s a
screenshot from <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/">http://www.speedtest.net/</a>

We both used <a href="https://www.apple.com/displays/">Apple 27&#8221; Cinema Displays</a>. On the receiving side of the share, I&#8217;m

time of writing this article, the pop filter is only $25.22 on Amazon Prime,
regular price $79.00, totally worth it!). This is the setup I use for podcasting
so it&#8217;s more than adequate for pairing. I use the audio from the Display Monitor
(Cinema Screen), as that&#8217;s behind the mic, so as not to cause any echoing.
Naturally, this only works in a private office. In a shared office, it&#8217;s
critical to have a very good mic/headset combo or a good mic. The Blue Snowball
mic does a pretty good job of filtering out background noise.
</p>

<p>
I did a quick search on Amazon to see what&#8217;s available for headsets. If budget
allows (and if you&#8217;re spending a fair bit of time pairing), I&#8217;d consider the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-Crossfade-Over-Ear-Noise-Isolating-Headphone/dp/B003BYRGKY/ref=sr_1_1?s=aht&ie=UTF8&qid=1399443063&sr=1-1&keywords=headset+with+microphone">V-MODA Crossfade LP Over-Ear Noise-Isolating Metal Headphone (Gunmetal Black)</a>
plus the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Gaming-Headset-Headphone/dp/B00BJ17WKK/ref=pd_bxgy_e_img_y">V-MODA BoomPro Gaming, VoIP Headset Headphone with Mic, Black</a> as both
have a very high number of 4+ reviews. It&#8217;s suspect that with the right audio
setup, the avoidance of distractions for an in-office/remote pair combo might be
superior to that of the in-office pair combo. Please post into the comments if
you have advice on the best headset for pairing.

<h2 id="sec-7">TLDR Miscellaneous Tips</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use <a href="http://screenhero.com/">Screenhero</a> for screen sharing.
</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/">Google Hangouts</a> or Facetime on a mobile device to share video of each
other. Prefer that over using Google Hangouts on your computer due to CPU
usage of Google Hangouts. I really like the iPad mini with the Apple folding
cover. It fits right under the Cinema
</li>
<li>Use large screen for screen sharing, an tablet for Google Hangouts.
</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to try your regular tools, such as <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a>.
</li>
<li>Use fast broadband, fast Macs, same size monitors.
</li>
<li>A good audio setup is well worth it.
</li>
<li>If the computer sharing the desktop has multiple monitors enabled, then the
remote sharing viewer might not be able to use command-tab to switch
applications. This problem went away when there was only one monitor on the
computer doing the sharing. It might depend upon whether the cmd-tab is
showing on the shared screen.
</li>
<li>If using RubyMine, install your pair&#8217;s keybinding into your RubyMine
preferences. You can copy the keybinding xml file located in
<code>~/Library/Preferences/RubyMine60/keymaps</code> and then restart RubyMine.
</li>
<li>Consider putting Screenhero in Full Screen mode to avoid any compression of
the window pixels. This is especially important when trying to click or drag
on the remote machine, such as resizing the chrome inspector area.
</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t forget to take a break for water, stretch, etc. every so often!
</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
What&#8217;s the most effective way to:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Start several different processes for Rails, such as Zeus, Rails server, rspec,
resque, and the scheduler.
</li>
<li>Have the output for each process in a separate tab.
</li>
<li>Not have the process pause when you scroll the output, as happens in tmux.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here&#8217;s a short demo of using tmuxinator to get a project running in several
iterm2 tabs:
</p>

<p>
<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/15Bxhu6-Xjc "></iframe></div>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Why Guard?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I use <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">Guard</a> for:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Automatically running rspec tests based on changes in either tests or source
files. Together with <a href="https://github.com/burke/zeus">Zeus</a>, I haven&#8217;t found a faster way to get immediate
feedback from tests. <i>Pro tip: Learn how to use <code>:focus</code> with your specs to configure exactly what tests to have guard run.</i>
</li>
<li>Automatically restarting the server when needed. For example, if you change
gems or routes, you need to restart the server.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
While I love running Guard with Zeus, <a href="https://github.com/rails/spring">Spring</a> is the default in Rails 4.1, so
I&#8217;ll probably give that a try in the near future.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Why Tmuxinator and Tmux?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator">Tmuxinator</a> is awesome for configuring the layout of several processes.
</p>

<p>
Here&#8217;s a sample tmuxinator file.
</p>

<p>
<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/9502375.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># First brew install tmux, gem install tmuxinator, and download item2
# Copy this file here: ~/.tmuxinator/my_project.yml
# Modify the paths (replace ~/my_project with your directory)
# Invoke with
#   mux project
# Then hit &#39;Ctrl-a d&#39; to detach
# Then run &#39;tmux -CC attach&#39;
# Make sure that option for iterm2 is General --&gt; tmux --&gt; When attaching, open unrecognized windows in Tabs
# Also, check option &quot;Automatically hide the tmux client session after connecting&quot;
# alias beg=&#39;bundle exec guard&#39;
# define guard groups for spec, server, worker
name: project
pre_window: cd ~/my_project
root: ~/my_project
windows:
  - zeus: zeus start
  - spec: beg -g spec
  - server: beg -g server
  - worker:
      layout: main-horizontal
      panes:
        - beg -g worker
        - scheduler</code></pre></noscript></div>

</p>

<p>
When I run the command
</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>mux my_project
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>
And then I see the following. This is way easier than opening up tabs in iTerm2
and running commands every time.
</p>

<p>
<img src="http://www.railsonmaui.com//images/2014-03-11-rocking-with-tmux-tmuxinator-and-iterm2-for-rails-development/tmuxinator-start.png">
</p>

<p>
The main problem with this setup is that if you scroll a window backwards (using
the tmux keyboard bindings), and you don&#8217;t un-scroll, then the process pauses,
such as the Rails server. <b>That&#8217;s super annoying</b>. Often I&#8217;m running specs, and
I want to scroll back to see a stack trace, but that prevents the continuation
of the test run! Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13924365/rails-freezes-when-searching-through-tmux-output-buffer">short discussion of the issue</a>.

<h2 id="sec-3">iTerm2 with tmux to the Rescue!</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
iTerm2 has <a href="https://code.google.com/p/iterm2/wiki/TmuxIntegration">wonderful tmux integration</a>. Here&#8217;s the steps I take:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Be sure have the latest versions of tmux, tmuxinator and iTerm2. As of this
article, I&#8217;m using: tmux: 1.9a, tmuxinator: 0.6.7, iTerm2: Build
1.0.0.20140112.
</li>
<li>Configure your Tmux to open tabs rather than windows. This is key to getting
the iTerm2 version to look like your original tmux session.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<img src="http://www.railsonmaui.com//images/2014-03-11-rocking-with-tmux-tmuxinator-and-iterm2-for-rails-development/tmuxinator-configuration.png">
</p>

<p>
Once you have the setup done, this is how I start my iTerm2-tmuxinator session:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Start tmuxinator with command <code>mux my_project</code>
</li>
<li>Hit <code>ctrl-a, d</code> to detach the tmux process.
</li>
<li>Run command =tmux -CC attach&#8221;
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here&#8217;s how it will look:
</p>

</p>

<p>
If you want to kill the session, you can run this command:
</p>
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>tmux <span class="nb">kill</span>-session -t my_project
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>
However, that sometimes does not kill all the processes. I often use these two
zsh scripts to ensure that everything is killed. It&#8217;s super important to kill
Zeus before running db migrations or gem updates.
</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h2 id="sec-4">Why Tmuxinator/tmux and not Foreman?</h2>

<p>
I use <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/foreman">Foreman</a> with Heroku and for running my rails server in production mode.
However, I prefer having different tabs provide console output for each of the
processes, rather than having all the console output blended together as Foreman
does. I&#8217;m also not sure if Foreman integrates with Guard.

<i>Note: This is a refresh of my original post from April, 2013 to adjust for Emacs 24.3 and org-mode 8.2.x</i>
</p>

<p>
WordPress seemed like a good blogging platform, but it just didn&#8217;t feel right. I
spend all my day editing text files using vim key-bindings, and I love <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a>
for all non-coding writing. If you don&#8217;t know Org Mode, it&#8217;s like having
Markdown mode on steroids. You can have a numbered list in Markdown, but
org-mode lets you re-order the list, and that&#8217;s just the beginning. Editing blog
documents in the WordPress editor felt almost as bad as being told to use MS
Word. I found that ergonomics of Org Mode, including all the goodness of recent
versions of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, including <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil">Evil</a> (Vim emulation), just made organization of
creative thoughts so much more enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
So I bit the bullet one weekend, and dove into <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, publishing my first
article, <a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/04/27/octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/">Octopress Setup with Github, Org Mode, and LiveReload</a>. The solution
presented in that article <a href="http://blog.paphus.com/blog/2012/08/01/introducing-octopress-blogging-for-org-mode/">Introducing Octopress Blogging for Org-Mode</a> stopped
working when I upgraded Emacs to 24.3 and org-mode to 8.2.x. Here&#8217;s a rehash of
my original article updated to the latest software versions as of March, 2014.
</p>

<p>
If you used to writing real web applications, rather than know the intricacies
of a giant monolithic blogging platform, then the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/theme/template/">customization of Octopress</a>
seems so much more straightforward. This is so much more like the Unix
philosophy that so many of us love, which is small and modular, rather than
monolithic.

<p>
I like <a href="https://github.com/robdodson/robdodson.github.com/blob/source/source/_posts/2012-04-30-custom-domain-with-octopress-and-github-pages.markdown">Rob Dodson&#8217;s summary</a> (noting Org Mode plus Emacs):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> is a blogging framework written by <a href="http://brandonmathis.com/">Brandon Mathis</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/imathis">@imathis</a>) which
sits on top of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a static site generator, meaning there&#8217;s no
database associated with your blog. Instead of writing everything in a WSYWIG
linked to MySQL (like Wordpress or Blogger) you produce text files using
Markdown which are then converted to static HTML. There are 3 huge benefits to
this approach. First, writing in Markdown (<b>org-mode</b> for me) is awesome. Once
you learn the syntax it&#8217;s incredibly fast and you don&#8217;t have to spend time
playing with a tiny little editor window just to add <i>some</i> <b>style</b> to your
posts. Second, writing in your favorite text editor is also awesome. I produce
everything in Sublime Text 2 (<b>Emacs</b> for me) and every day I discover new
tricks to make the process better. If you&#8217;ve ever had to write a blog post
using one of those horrible little TinyMCE editors you will appreciate this
feature. And lastly, static HTML is <b>fast</b>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This article should be useful for:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Any interest in using org-mode to publish to Octopress including some
reasons I use Org Mode (with Emacs).
</li>
<li>Some explanation of what Octopress and git are doing.
</li>
<li>Anybody curious about how using free github pages works to host Octopress.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Incidentally, since my blog is hosted using github pages, the source code and
configuration I use to generate it can all be found <a href="https://github.com/justin808/justin808.github.io">here</a>. See the notes below on
the difference between the <code>source</code> and <code>master</code> branches.

<li><a href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/04/30/custom-domain-with-octopress-and-github-pages/">Rob Dodson on Octopress</a>: Start off with these instructions from this posting
on April 30th, 2012. There are a few differences worth noting:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You should change the .rvmrc to a .ruby-version file
</li>
<li>Github recommends your deployment repository be named <code>yourname.github.io</code>,
not <code>yourname.github.com</code>.
</li>
<li>After you run <code>rake setup_github_pages</code> and before running <code>rake
      generate</code>, you should run <code>rake install</code>. If you forget, there&#8217;s a clear
message indicating this omission.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Customize <code>octopress/_config.yml</code>. The yaml file contains descriptions.
</li>

document (<code>.org</code> file) in <code>source/org_posts</code> into a <code>.html</code> document in
<code>source/_posts</code>. Once the html document is saved in _posts, the <code>rake watch</code>
task picks up the change and deploys the file. <b>Neat!</b>
</p>

<p>
Here are the basic steps:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Install Emacs 24.3 and use the package manager to install org-mode and
   <a href="https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress">org-octopress</a>.
</li>
<li>See my Emacs configuration below.
</li>
<li>Note, there are two ways to use org-octopress. I do not use its features to
automate the setup of the directories. This automated setup does not provide
a way to have &#8220;pages&#8221;. As of March, 2014, you can only have &#8220;posts&#8221;. Instead,
my configuration below handles the mapping of directories.
</li>
<li><del>Images work fine.</del> Well, almost fine. The big gotcha is that the standard
inclusion of images in org-mode results in broken paths at deployment. The
workaround is to embed the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/image-tag/">Octopress syntax for an image</a>, and to place the
images under source/images. Note, you&#8217;ll want to be sure to use an absolute
path, or else your article might look OK on the home page, but might now work
in the postings directory. If I&#8217;m creating a document with many images, I&#8217;ll
group the images for that document in a sub-directory of images named like
the document. This is how it should look. The trick is to place the
octopress <code>img</code> directive within a HTML begin/end block.

</li>
<li><b>Links</b>: This is key thing to get right. It&#8217;s critical to understand the
issues links, or else you&#8217;ll have one of these issues:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Links work when you test your blog locally using <code>pow</code>, but not when you
go to your published website. This happens if you use a relative link from
blog articles, because blog articles sometimes appear on your home page
and sometimes under the <code>/blog</code> directory. You have to use your domain
address to link from blog articles to other articles on your blog.
</li>
<li>You&#8217;d like your local links to point to the correct local spot. You can do
this for links on static pages, but just not blog articles. Thus, for
non-blog articles, it&#8217;s preferable to use the <code>file:</code> relative path format
(just not <code>file:/</code> absolute path and not <code>file:~/</code>).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Here&#8217;s the rules:</b>
</p>

<p>
Links from static pages, relatively specified to other static pages and to
posts. Ensure that there&#8217;s no <code>/</code> immediately following <code>file:</code>. For example:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[file:telecommuting.html][Why telecommuting works and how I maximize productivity]]
</pre>
<p>
Or if the link is one level under the current directory:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[file:misc/telecommuting.html][Why telecommuting works and how I maximize productivity]]
</pre>
<p>
Links from a <i>page</i> to a <i>post</i> can use a relative link like this.
<i>Important: you must use the <code>YYYY/MM/DD/blog-title/index.html</code> format! and you must specify the article title.</i>
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[file:../blog/2013/04/27/octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/index.html][Org-Mode Octopress Setup V2]]
</pre>
<p>
<b>However</b>, links from posts to other posts require an absolute URL using your
published domain name. The big gotcha is that blog posts sometimes are shown
on the home page and sometimes inside of the blog directory. To avoid
trouble, you need to follow a format as this example shows. It&#8217;s easiest to
copy the URL from the browser address bar.
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/05/08/strategies-for-rails-logging-and-error-handling/][Strategies for Rails Logging and Error Handling]]
</pre>
<p>
I tried using a <code>file:../blog</code> syntax, but that either would work on the home
page or in the specific blog article, but not both. <code>http:/blog</code> links would
work in Chrome but not mobile Safari. Hopefully, one day we&#8217;ll be able to
specify relative links from blog article to blog article. <i>For now, this is a
big <b>gotcha</b>.</i>
<b>Tip</b>: You can specify relative links between org pages using the <code>.org</code> file
suffix, rather than html. The earlier example could have been specified as:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[file:misc/telecommuting.org][Why telecommuting works and how I maximize productivity]]
</pre>
<p>
That allows you to put your cursor on the link in emacs, and hit F12 to go
the org file! I&#8217;ve got <code>F12</code> mapped to <code>org-open-at-point</code>. Awesome!
</p>
</li>
<li>Bold and italic styling (text inside of stars and /) was a bit of mystery
using the standard theme. Octopress has styling for <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>. Org-mode spits out <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tags.
Add this to <code>sass/custom/_fonts.scss</code>.
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">b</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">bold</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">i</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">font-style</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">italic</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>
Code styling (text inside of equals) <code>like this</code> did not work after a code block unless I added
the <code>div</code> tag to this line around 100 in <code>_syntax.scss</code>. You&#8217;re just adding
the <code>div</code> selector.

<h2 id="sec-8">Deploying to Github: Directory Structure of Octopress and the master and source Git Branches</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
Github offers free hosting of both the blog deployment and source. You&#8217;re
looking at the deployment right now. You can find the source here at
<a href="https://github.com/justin808/justin808.github.io">my git repo justin808.github.io</a>. I doubt you could beat the price, performance, and
convenience. You can look inside of this repo, clone it, etc. and you have
everything that it took to make this blog.
</p>

<p>
I originally was quite confused by the concept of using two separate git
branches to make up what gets deployed on the live website versus the git
repository of my articles. Plus, there&#8217;s the issue of Octopress git repository
that you clone when starting out. Eventually, I figured out that the two branches
simply contain different files, with one containing the original Octopress
files. Here&#8217;s a few screen grabs that might clarify the situation for you.
</p>

<p>
Don&#8217;t forget that you never push to the master branch, but rather the <code>rake
deploy</code> task does it for you. Instead, you run <code>git push origin source</code> to push
the content of your blog to github.
</p>

<p>
The <code>octopress/public</code> directory corresponds to what you&#8217;ll find on the github
site for your deployment (master branch).
</p>

<p>
<img src="http://www.railsonmaui.com//images/2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/public-dir-corresponds-master-branch.png">
</p>

<p>
The octopress/.gitignore file contains entries like <code>public</code>, which essentially
keeps the <code>rake generate</code> files out of the source branch.
</p>

<p>
Here&#8217;s the github master branch right after creation. Note the correspondence
with <code>public</code>. This is what gets deployed as your blog.
<img src="http://www.railsonmaui.com//images/2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/github-master-branch.png">
</p>

<p>
Here&#8217;s the github source branch. This contains the octopress environment, as
well as your customizations and blog posts.

    <updated>2014-02-23T21:43:00-10:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.railsonmaui.com//blog/2014/02/23/simple-form-and-disable-processing-by-default</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">TLDR</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Here&#8217;s an easy way to have all your SimpleForm submit buttons default to setting
<code>data-disable-with</code> so that you don&#8217;t get errors when users double click on
submit buttons. If you&#8217;ve gotten a few <code>ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique</code> errors
that were hard to reproduce, then here&#8217;s your solution, with our without
SimpleForm. Additionally, using <code>data-disable-with</code> provides the user with nice
feedback once a button is clicked.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique Error!</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
If you&#8217;re using Devise, and you get a <code>ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique</code> error when
a new user is signing up, where do you look?
</p>

<pre class="example">
An ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique occurred in registrations#create:

PG::UniqueViolation: ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint
"index_users_on_email" DETAIL: Key (email)=(somebody@yahoo.com) already
exists. : INSERT INTO "users" ("address", "city", "confirmation_sent_at",
"confirmation_token", "created_at", "default_location_id", "email",
"encrypted_password", "first_name", "last_name", "mobile", "role", "state",
"updated_at", "zip_code") VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11,
$12, $13, $14, $15) RETURNING "id"
</pre>

<p>
At first, I was concerned that my unique index on my users table is not case
insensitive. I started going down the road of converting my normal unique index
on users.email to this index:
</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">UNIQUE</span> <span class="k">INDEX</span> <span class="n">users_email_ci_idx</span> <span class="k">ON</span> <span class="n">users</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="k">lower</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="p">)));</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>
However, I soon figured out that Devise was already always saving email in the
database in lower case via a <code>before_validation</code> hook.
</p>

<p>
So then I tried to double click the <code>SAVE</code> button, and, <b>BOOM</b>, I got the same error.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">data-disable-with=&#8217;Processing&#x2026;&#8217;</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
A little bit of googling quickly revealed some handy rails techniques disabling
a submit button after being clicked, namely the setting of attribute
data-disable-with: &#8220;Some Message&#x2026;&#8221; on both links and buttons. This works
nicely to fix the double submit RecordNotUnique error, and it provides some
sweet user feedback upon clicking a button. Here&#8217;s an example of a <code>SAVE</code> button.

<p>
<img src="http://www.railsonmaui.com//images/2014-02-23-simple-form-and-disable-processing-by-default/button-before-clicking.jpg">
</p>

<p>
Immediately after clicking the <code>SAVE</code> button, the button disables and the text changes.

Even better, this can be done in one place for all SimpleForm submit buttons!

In a file like <code>config/simple_form.rb</code>, place this initialization code:

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>
What the bit of code above does is that it:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Opens up the FormBuilder class to add a method <code>submit_with_override</code>.
</li>
<li>Modifies options hash&#8217;s :data element, setting a default value for key
<code>disable_with</code> that will not apply if there&#8217;s already a value there, thus
allowing the default to be overridden by any individual button.
</li>
<li>Calls <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/Module/alias_method_chain">alias_method_chain</a> which makes is so that a call to submit actually
calls <code>submit_with_override</code> and that method can call
<code>submit_without_override</code>, which is the original <code>submit</code> method. The pattern
of naming the methods <code>with_override</code> and <code>without_override</code> is part of the
<code>alias_method_chain</code> call. Pretty darn cool!
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here&#8217;s a sample sign-up form that overrides the default &#8220;Processing&#x2026;&#8221; label
when the <code>SAVE</code> button is clicked.

RubyMine&#8217;s interactive search/replace is awesome. The Regexp feature is
especially useful. Not only will it help you edit faster, but it will improve
your ability to write RegExp&#8217;s in your code. When do you need to use a regexp?
Whenever a standard find/replace won&#8217;t cut it. For example, if you changing the

The following screencast shows how you can interactively use the Regexp feature
to figure out the right regexp to search for as well as the right replacement.
</p>

<p>
In this example, I&#8217;m replacing one rspec syntax with a replacement one.
</p>

<pre class="example">
it \{ expect\(my_subject\.(\w+)\)\.to eq\((.*)\) }
</pre>

<p>
Replace with:
</p>
<pre class="example">
its(:$1) { should eq($2) }
</pre>

<p>
Here&#8217;s a few key tips:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Be sure to first check the regexp check-box if you&#8217;ll need that.
</li>
<li>As you type each character into the search box, observe if you&#8217;re increasing
your match area to get what you want.
</li>
<li>If a character doesn&#8217;t match, then try escaping the character. For example,
I had to escape the <code>{</code> and <code>(</code> as those characters have special meaning in
the regexp.
</li>
<li>Once you get a match with the right groupings for replacement, then put in
the <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, etc. into the replacement box to refine your replacement string.
</li>
<li>Then hit Opt-P (or Alt-P) to replace.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
This is best shown with this 2 minute screencast.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
I migrated from Bash to Zsh in October and I&#8217;m quite thrilled with zsh.

<h2 id="sec-1">Motivation</h2>

<p>
What motivated me to finally move?
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I no longer used the shell within Emacs. If you have a bash setup that works
well in Emacs, don&#8217;t try to switch. Since moving from emacs bindings to
evil-mode, I am quite comfortable in Vim, so I find myself using iTerm way
more than the Emacs shell.
</li>
<li>While doing some pair programming with <a href="https://twitter.com/jakeonrails">@jakeonrails</a>, I saw the coolness of
zsh, which he pointed out to me &#8220;was no big deal&#8221;, just what&#8217;s on the

<h2 id="sec-2">Tips on Migrating</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Here&#8217;s a few tips to somebody migrating might find useful:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Try out <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> and take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes">themes examples</a>. The themes seem to
be all customizations of the prompt. I&#8217;ll share what I came up with at the
bottom, which is a modification of the default robbyrussell theme.
</li>
<li>While most of your bash code will migrate as-is, this is a good time to clean
up some cruft in your files. I like to organize my shell code into small
files, each with a particular theme, and then have the .zshrc source those,
rather than having a giant .zshrc file.
</li>
<li>The oh-my-zsh plugins are way for you to share shell configuration with
other members of the community. It&#8217;s simple to read what those plugins are
doing. Many are just setting aliases. I started to migrate my own
configuration code by converting to plugins, but then I realized that that&#8217;s
overkill. If I ever want to share the configuration, at that point, I can
convert to a plugin, which is quite simple.
</li>
<li>If you have any shell functions that use <code>[</code>, you might have escape that
character for zsh.
</li>
<li>If you install zsh plugins, be very careful with any newly installed aliases
from the plugins. I previously had <code>gl</code> aliased as &#8216;git log&#8217; and the git
plugin uses <code>gl</code> for <code>git pull</code>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19085203/recovering-from-accidental-git-pull-on-octopress-branches">which caused me a huge headache</a> when I ran
that within my octopress branch.
</li>
<li>You need to escape the <code>^</code> character for commands such as <code>git reset HEAD\^</code>
</li>
</ol>

In the third line of this function, I had to escape the <code>[</code> and the <code>]</code>.

To set this up, I created a custom theme called justin808 by doing the following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create a theme file <code>oh_my_zsh/custom/justin808.zsh-theme</code>. See below.
</li>
<li>Export the theme name.

    <updated>2013-09-22T16:23:00-10:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.railsonmaui.com//blog/2013/09/22/gogaruco-2013</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
This past weekend was my first <a href="http://gogaruco.com/">GoGaRuCo</a>. Here&#8217;s a perspective from a newbie,
along with lots of photos.
</p>
<a target=_ href=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=674318365913265&set=a.674315479246887.1073741830.484394724905631&type=1>
<p>
<img src="http://www.railsonmaui.com//images/2013-09-22-gogaruco-2013/GoGaRuCo1.jpg">
</p>
</a>

<p>
The number one thing I discovered is that GoGaRuCo, like Ruby, is not just about
code. It&#8217;s about the awesome people and the community. 
</p>

<p>
If you just want to see the talks at GoGaRuCo, don&#8217;t attend. All of the talks
will be available on web shortly. So why did the conference sell out, with about
200 wait-listed people begging to attend?
</p>

<p>
GoGaRuCo attendees are madly passionate about programming, especially in Ruby.
Most attendees work at start-ups, at web consulting firms, or as freelancers.
The common thread is that we all love to program. It&#8217;s not work. It&#8217;s a passion.
And it&#8217;s artistic, cutting-edge, relevant, and fun!
</p>

<p>
Amongst the community, there&#8217;s a genuine feeling that we&#8217;re all in this
together, and the more we can help each other, the better off we and the world
will be. This is truly the open source spirit of contributing whatever code you
can give back to the community. Consequently, for me, attending the conference
was about meeting others who contribute to open-source and learning more about
how I can contribute. As a bonus, I got a chance to personally meet the people
whom I follow on Twitter, read their blogs, and use their open source.

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Upgrading Octopress]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.railsonmaui.com//blog/2013/09/15/upgrading-octopress/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-15T22:08:00-10:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.railsonmaui.com//blog/2013/09/15/upgrading-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
One of the criticisms of Octopress is how there&#8217;s no clear separation of the static
generation engine and the content of one&#8217;s website, and thus upgrading Octopress
is difficult. I delayed upgrading due to this. However, my concerns were
unfounded, as it was very painless to upgrade Octopress.
</p>

<p>
The instructions boil down to this short help page on <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/updating/">Updating Octopress</a>:
</p>
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>git pull octopress master     <span class="c"># Get the latest Octopress</span>
</span><span class='line'>bundle install                <span class="c"># Keep gems updated</span>
</span><span class='line'>rake update_source            <span class="c"># update the template&#39;s source</span>
</span><span class='line'>rake update_style             <span class="c"># update the template&#39;s style</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>
The first step resulted in a few merge conflicts. I find RubyMine&#8217;s git conflict
resolution tools helpful, so I used those. Here&#8217;s a short <a href="http://youtu.be/x74Gd2lDC1A">screencast</a> (embedded
below) showing you how these tools helped with this process. Besides some minor
issues dealing with a few merge conflicts, there was nothing very interesting or
eventful about the upgrade, which means that the current process is really quite
OK.
</p>

<p>
I hope a few people find this demo of the RubyMine git conflict resolution tool
helpful. The key takeaways from this video are:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Merge conflicts show up as red in the list of changes.
<img src="http://www.railsonmaui.com//images/2013-09-15-upgrading-octopress/conflicts-red.jpg">
</li>

<li>Try the diff&#8217;ing buttons in the upper left to get 2 way views of
the 3 way merge.
<img src="http://www.railsonmaui.com//images/2013-09-15-upgrading-octopress/merge-window.jpg">
</li>
</ol>

<p>
3, &#8220;Yours&#8221; means your local changes, and &#8220;Theirs&#8221; means the server&#8217;s changes,
   or, in this case, the changes in the main Octopress development branch.
</p>

<p>
Did the upgrade work? You&#8217;re looking at the results of it.
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s worth noting that I had one slight snag. When I merged sass/screen.scss, I
accidentally removed this line, which is used for the youtube plugin.
</p>
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='scss'><span class='line'><span class="k">@import</span> <span class="s2">&quot;custom/rve&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<p>
I could have figured this out by examining the history of the file and noting
that I had added this line, rather than it being part of Octopress. So yes, it
would be bit better if there was a cleaner separation between the Octopress
code and any enhancements. However, the current mechanism works, and it&#8217;s still
thousands of times better than WordPress.

    <id>http://www.railsonmaui.com//blog/2013/08/06/migrating-from-capybara-webkit-to-poltergeist-phantomjs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Motivation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Today I migrated a medium size test suite from <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit">capybara-webkit</a> to <a href="https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist">Poltergeist</a>
with <a href="http://phantomjs.org/index.html">PhantomJS</a>. I had two main motivations for switching:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>PhantomJS is more sensitive to avoiding false positives. For example, in the
past, one could click on non-visible DOM elements with capybara-webkit.
While this may not currently be true with the latest Capybara, I&#8217;ve had good
luck with PhantomJS in the past.
</li>
<li>Speed. When I last checked, PhantomJS was faster. Speed is critical for slow
feature tests.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here&#8217;s one reason that Poltergeist is more accurate and <a href="https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist">sensitive to failure</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When Poltergeist clicks on an element, rather than generating a DOM click event,
it actually generates a &#8220;proper&#8221; click. This is much closer to what happens when
a real user clicks on the page - but it means that Poltergeist must scroll the
page to where the element is, and work out the correct co-ordinates to click. If
the element is covered up by another element, the click will fail (this is a
good thing - because your user won&#8217;t be able to click a covered up element
either).
</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Tips for Migrating</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
</div><div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">Upgrade Gems First</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
At first, I lost time due to timing issues where I was clicking on elements of a
hidden dialog that was not finished showing. Capybara-webkit was not bothered by
the fact that the dialog was actually hidden and being loaded. PhantomJS bombed
out. However, after I worked around the issue, I realized that my gems were
outdated. Since you&#8217;re going to be fixing a bunch of tests anyway, it makes
sense to get on the latest versions of the testing gems. The gems you want to
upgrade are: rspec, rspec-rails, Capybara, and poltergeist. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Visible Option</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
After upgrading the gems, my workarounds were no longer necessary. However, the
change from Capybara 2.0 to 2.1 had a big change in the way that it handles
finding dom elements that are <b>not visible</b>. Previously, Capybara would not care
if the dom element was hidden. For my tests, this resulted in breaking any tests
that queried any non-visible DOM elements, such as scripts, meta tags, and
links.
</p>

<p>
The key thing to be aware of is that you might get this obscure error message,
and the fix is to add the <code>visible: false</code> optional parameter so that Capybara
is not filtering by <code>visible: true</code>. The <code>visible</code> parameter is available to
most finder methods in Capybara.
</p>

<p>
The obscure error you might see is something like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#=&gt; Capybara::ExpectationNotMet Exception: expected to find xpath "//title" with text "Title Text." but there were no matches. Also found "", which matched the selector but not all filters.
</pre>

<p>
The reason is the title element is not visible, and &#8220;visible&#8221; is the &#8220;not all
filters&#8221; part of the error message.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Debugging Capybara Tests</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
The main reasons that previously passing feature tests will fail when migrating
to Poltergeist is due to timing and visibility. The two main techniques for
debugging Capybara tests are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Using screen shots (<code>render_page</code> below)
</li>
<li>Using HTML dumps (=page! below)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Keep in mind that these methods will not wait for elements to load. Thus, you
should either have a Capybara statement that will wait for some DOM element to
load or you might want to put in a <code>sleep 10</code> to sleep for 10 seconds before
capturing the screen shot or dumping the HTML.
</p>

<p>
If you use the helper methods specified below, and you should be able to work
through why Poltergeist is not doing what you think it should be doing. So far,
I haven&#8217;t yet run into a case where I have not found out that it&#8217;s been my fault
rather than a bug in Poltergeist that&#8217;s caused a failure due to the migration.
In many cases, you&#8217;ll be somewhat pleasantly surprised that you&#8217;ll be fixing a
false positive.

<h3 id="sec-2-4">Capybara&#8217;s Wait Strategy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
Be sure to carefully read the <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara documentation</a>, especially the part
titled &#8220;Asynchronous JavaScript&#8221;. That section explains how Capybara cleverly
will wait until the page or ajax call finished so that the element expected
appears. There&#8217;s a configurable timeout (<code>Capybara.default_wait_time</code>) for
changing the default wait time before a test bombs out.

Be sure to understand the difference between <code>//something</code> and <code>.//something</code>.
The later can be used inside a <code>within</code> block. The former will find the tag
anywhere on the page, even when used inside of a <code>within</code> block!

The first post in this series, <a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/05/26/ember-dot-js-hello-world/">Ember.js Hello World</a>, shows Ember working
without a persistence backend. This post covers setting up Rails4 as the
persistence engine behind that example, plus adding and deleting records. The
amount of Ember and Rails code to make this example is almost completely
included in this article. It&#8217;s that tiny!
</p>

<p>
The source code for the completed example can be found on GitHub:
<a href="https://github.com/justin808/ember-js-guides-railsonmaui-rails4">justin808/ember-js-guides-railsonmaui-rails4</a>. I carefully crafted the commits
to explain the steps.

<p>
I put many more details in this <a href="http://youtu.be/ac1mYhCMRNc">comprehensive screencast</a> of how to go from a
brand new Rails 4 app to an Ember.js app deployed on Heroku.

<h2 id="sec-1">Key Tips</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Be sure to update the <code>ember</code> and <code>ember-data</code> javascript files with the
command from the ember-rails gem (see below). Keeping these files at
appropriate versions is key while the API is changing, especially for
ember-data.
</li>
<li>If you specify the Router property for both <code>model</code> and <code>setupController</code>,
you can have some very confusing results (details below).
</li>
<li>Get comfortable with Ember&#8217;s naming conventions. Ember does a ton with
default naming. It&#8217;s basically got the same philosophy of &#8220;Convention over
Configuration&#8221; of Rails. So it&#8217;s especially important to try to grok when the
Ember examples are doing something implicitly versus explicitly. This is a
bit like Rails. At first it seems like magic, like &#8220;How the heck is that
happening&#8221;, and then one gets accustomed to the naming conventions and
appreciates how much code it saves.
</li>
<li>Be mindful that some Ember.js commands run asynchronously, such as commit.

Originally, I included a separate version of ember-data in the git repository.
Instead, I should have updated the versions of ember and ember-data with this
command from the <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails">ember-rails README</a>:
</p>
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>rails generate ember:install --head
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<p>
This command puts the ember files in <code>vendor/assets/ember</code>. Pretty sweet. This
is way better than manually installing the js files.

Next, I migrated the non-rails static example presented in <a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/05/26/ember-dot-js-hello-world/">Ember.js Hello World</a>
to the rails framework. You can checkout the tag <code>no-persistence</code> and get the
code to where the static fixture is used and there is no persistence. Scroll to
the bottom to see this code, as well as some additional code added for persistence.

You can&#8217;t update the URL after a new record is saved directly in the event
handler, as the commit will run asynchronously, and until the return value,
there is no record id, and you would end up using record id <code>null</code> in the URL.
Here&#8217;s how to handle this situation. Not that the <code>save</code> does the commit, but
the <code>transitionToRoute</code> is not called until the <code>transitionAfterSave</code> hook is
run.

<blockquote>
<p>
See discussion at
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14705124/creating-a-record-with-ember-js-ember-data-rails-and-handling-list-of-record">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14705124/creating-a-record-with-ember-js-ember-data-rails-and-handling-list-of-record</a>
Note the change from iterating over &#8220;each model&#8221; to iterating over &#8220;each post in
filteredContent&#8221; in index.html.erb. That change requires attributes be
referenced by &#8220;post&#8221;, and the updated linkTo takes the route, &#8220;post&#8221;, as well as
the &#8220;dynamic segment&#8221; which is also named &#8220;post&#8221;, per the above #each post.
(refer to <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/templates/links/">http://emberjs.com/guides/templates/links/</a>). Note the addition of the
PostsController. Previously, it was implicitly defined. It listens to property
&#8220;arrangedContent.@each&#8221; so that when the new post saves, the filteredContent
property updates and notifies the view template using this property in
index.html.erb. Without the listener on this property, the view of all posts
would not update.

Ember does quite a lot with just a few lines of code. Definitely check out the
source code for the completed example github:

Here&#8217;s 3 useful tools for using <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> for web development, possibly with
Rails and EmberJs. All 3 tools are useful for different purposes. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">CoffeeScript Source Maps: Debugging CoffeeScript Directly</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
With Source Maps, you don&#8217;t have to mentally convert your CoffeeScript code into
JavaScript code in the debugger. Instead, you can now see your CoffeeScript
code, even with correct line numbers. This rails gem, <a href="https://github.com/markbates/coffee-rails-source-maps">coffee-rails-source-maps</a>,
makes it easy to include CoffeeScript source maps as part of your rails
application. Note, the <code>Rails.env.development?</code> is hard coded, so this only works
when you use that specific environment. You can also do it manually, by using
the <code>-m</code> flag with the <code>coffee</code> command.

<h2 id="sec-2">Try CoffeeScript Chrome Extension: Converting between CoffeeScript and JavaScript</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/try-coffeescript-enhanced/fldhkfldchaibgaheaogapecjmnkaepe?hl=en">Try CoffeeScript Enhanced</a> Chrome extension is pretty nice for converting
between JavaScript and CoffeeScript. The main advantage over
<a href="http://js2coffee.org">http://js2coffee.org</a> is that the you don&#8217;t have to open a new browser tab, and
you can enter either CoffeeScript or JavaScript.

<h2 id="sec-2">Details</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Ember.js is really amazing. The place to start is <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/">Tom Dale&#8217;s Intro Tutorial Video</a>
(on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Ga99hMi7wfY">Youtube</a>). In the 30 minute video you build the app shown here in this
iframe. Some of the features you&#8217;ll learn include:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Basic setup for an Ember.js app.
</li>
<li>Nested views. You can click on the articles on the left, and see the
articles on the right.
</li>
<li>Ember helpers which provide markdown and date conversion with a tiny bit of code.
</li>
<li>Even how to do a read/write REST interface. 
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If a picture is worth a thousand words, here&#8217;s what you build in the video (you
can try in the iframe below or a <a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/tutorials/ember-js-guides-railsonmaui/index.html">separate tab</a>). The dynamic mvc nature of the
bindings is neat. Try this:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Click on the article &#8220;Octopress&#8221; on the left.
</li>
<li>Click Edit, change the markdown in the 2nd field, and see it change below
dynamically!
</li>
</ol>
<div><iframe src='http://www.railsonmaui.com//tutorials/ember-js-guides-railsonmaui/index.html' width='100%' height='600px'></iframe></div>

<p>
Then try out the &#8220;Ember Inspector for Chrome&#8221;. Yehuda does a nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18OSYuhk0Yo">demo of it on
youtube</a> (more <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/wycats/videos">here</a>). You can follow the <a href="http://www.kaspertidemann.com/how-to-try-out-the-ember-inspector-in-google-chrome/">installation instructions from Kasper Tidemann</a>.
Basically you want to install the chrome extension files from
<a href="https://github.com/tildeio/ember-extension">github.com/tildeio/ember-extension</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once you do that, you can browse to open the sample on <a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/tutorials/ember-js-guides-railsonmaui/index.html">separate tab</a> and see
this:
</p>

<p>
<img src="http://www.railsonmaui.com//images/2013-05-26-ember-dot-js-hello-world/ember-inspector.png">
</p>

<p>
You can click on most of the purple text to dig into the ember objects:
<img src="http://www.railsonmaui.com//images/2013-05-26-ember-dot-js-hello-world/ember-inspector-2.png">
</p>

<p>
You can view <i>&lt;computed&gt;</i> values:
<img src="http://www.railsonmaui.com//images/2013-05-26-ember-dot-js-hello-world/ember-inspector-3.png">
</p>

<p>
To make it easier for you, I created git repos of the <a href="https://github.com/justin808/ember-js-guides-railsonmaui-start">start</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/justin808/ember-js-guides-railsonmaui-no-rest">finish</a>,
minus the REST interface. 
</p>

<p>
To maximize your learning efficiency: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Start with the files in the <a href="https://github.com/justin808/ember-js-guides-railsonmaui-start">starter repo that I created</a>. The Ember.js files
are still changing, so your combination of js files is critical. There&#8217;s heaps
of comments on the youtube video about how frustrating it can be to have the
wrong combination of js files.
</li>
<li>Try building the app yourself by following the video. If you&#8217;re short on time,
watch the demo once and say &#8220;that&#8217;s damn cool&#8221;. But you won&#8217;t truly absorb the
content without following along. Plus, it&#8217;s super cool to enter some
statements in the console and see the magic of ember happen. (16:52 in the
video).
</li>
<li>When you have an error in your code (which you will if you&#8217;re practicing
this), you need to know that you look for errors in the browser&#8217;s console.
</li>
</ul>

Looking for a great open source example of a <i>production quality</i>
rails, emberjs, and single-page-application project? Check out <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">Discourse</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Discourse is the 100% open source, next-generation discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here&#8217;s a great example of the Discourse code in action: <a href="http://meta.discourse.org/t/is-it-better-for-discourse-to-use-javascript-or-coffeescript/3153">Is it better for
Discourse to use JavaScript or CoffeeScript?</a>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Production Quality, not a Tutorial</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Note, this is an example of a <i>production quality</i> application, rather than a
useful tutorial sample application. What&#8217;s the difference? The Discourse
codebase is the real deal, including all the gory details, such as performance
optimizations. If you want a superb sample rails application, check out <a href="https://github.com/railstutorial/sample_app_2nd_ed">Rails
Tutorial, 2nd Ediition</a> and read the book <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">Ruby on Rails Tutorial, Learn Web
Development with Rails, Michael Hartl</a>. There&#8217;s even an interesting discussion on
the Discourse blog about <a href="http://blog.discourse.org/2013/04/discourse-as-your-first-rails-app/">Discourse as Your First Rails App</a>, which it shouldn&#8217;t be.
</p>

<p>
That being said, the Discourse code base is probably as good as or, in many
cases, better than what you&#8217;ll find in many software-as-a-service companies.
It&#8217;s no secret that public scrutiny of popular open source code really raises
the bar on quality. Consequently, if you&#8217;re a serious and experienced Rails
developer, it&#8217;s worth your time to install the source of discourse and explore
and run it. I just did that and I&#8217;m impressed.

Basically, there&#8217;s a few dependencies to install, some of which you probably already
have installed, such as Postgres and Redis. The main gotcha I faced was to make
sure that you run the postgres instructions for <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/DEVELOPMENT-OSX-NATIVE.md">creating the development
database</a>, rather than using the rake task. Then you can install the seed data:
</p>
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>psql -d discourse_development &lt; pg_dumps/development-image.sql
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>
The rake task to do <code>rake db:seed_fu</code> does not install the sample data, but
rather some tiny bit of &#8220;seed&#8221; data (like post action types).
</p>

<p>
Once you have the test data installed, then run these commands.
</p>
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>bundle install <span class="c"># Yes, this DOES take a while. No, it&#39;s not really cloning all of rubygems :-)</span>
</span><span class='line'>rake db:migrate
</span><span class='line'>rake db:test:prepare
</span><span class='line'>rake db:seed_fu
</span><span class='line'>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>rspec <span class="c"># All specs should pass</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>
You should have installed <a href="http://mailcatcher.me/">MailCatcher</a>, so that you don&#8217;t have to configure any
smtp server. Then you just have to visit <a href="http://localhost:1080">http://localhost:1080</a> to see the mail
messages that Discourse sends.
</p>

<p>
Then to run the Discourse application (assuming postgres and redis are running)
open up two tabs. Cd each to the disource directory. 
</p>
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>rails server
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>sidekiq

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>clockwork config/clock.rb
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>
Or, install foreman (<code>gem install foreman</code>) and run (runs the <code>Procfile</code>).
</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

How do ensure that your application properly handles errors, especially when
relying on third parties, such as payment processors? Is it easy to verify that
the right things happen when the wrong things happen? Last week&#8217;s article
<a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/05/08/strategies-for-rails-logging-and-error-handling/">Strategies for Rails Logging and Error Handling</a> discussed some techniques to
setup a good error handling strategy. Here&#8217;s some techniques to verify that your
application does what you expect it to do when things go wrong. The key message
is to check how your application handles errors, before your customers do.

<h2 id="sec-1">Your Code Depends on Outside Systems (That Might Raise Errors)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Suppose you&#8217;ve created the super-duper Rails storefront application that takes
online payments. You may even have some unit tests that verify the code. Then
you get the dreaded call that customers are being charged twice and their
orders are not processed. WTF?
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s not entirely obvious how to verify proper error handling when outside
systems fail, or even when odd errors are raised from your own code. Payment
processing deserves some special attention because it&#8217;s a dependency on an
outside service (the payment processor) and will typically require database
updates based on the result of the payment processing. If you&#8217;re updating
several tables, then you&#8217;ll want to use a transaction to ensure that all or
nothing saves. While code review and manual testing are good first steps, you
should consider a few extra steps with error handling for sensitive parts of
your application.

<h2 id="sec-2">Verification of Error Handling Strategy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Typically, error handling code is not well tested. It&#8217;s much more common to test
the &#8220;happy path&#8221; of everything going right.
</p>

<p>
Let&#8217;s look at hypothetical example and some tests that can flush out some
errors.
</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>
So what can go wrong?
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Payment Processing is Like a 2-Phase Commit</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Conceptually, you want a transaction, such that it&#8217;s all or nothing. If the
charge goes through, then so does everything else. Payment processing like a
2-phase commit, except one has to handle all the what-ifs to be sure that it&#8217;s
handled correctly.
</p>

<p>
The general steps of payment processing are like this:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Connect to outside resource to make charge.
</li>
<li>Update database records indicating charge successful.
</li>
<li>Fulfill the order.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Rails transactions work such than any exception in the block will cause the
transaction to be rolled back. The problem with the above code is what happens
if fulfill_order throws an exception? The customer has been charged, the order
was updated to reflect payment, but then <b>ka-boom</b> and an exception is raised,
and any database updates to the order are rolled back, <b>but the payment is not
refunded</b>. The customer is confused as there is a charge but nothing else. How
could you have tested (and avoided) this?
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Brute Force Methodology</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
You can simulate error conditions by manually placing =raise &#8220;any error message&#8221;=
statements in your code, and then testing, say in the UI manually. This is a
good first step to verify that your error handling is working correctly. You
might raise a specific error, if say your payment processor throws a specific
type of error.
</p>

<p>
For the above example, the different methods referenced, such as <code>process_order</code>
can get modified with a single line at the beginning, which would be:
</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">process_order</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Any error message&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># Lots of other code that can be commented out</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>
Then go into the UI and test placing an order. Consider the following questions:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Was the right error message displayed to the user?
</li>
<li>Was the right information logged at the correct log level?
</li>
<li>Was an automatic email sent regarding the error?
</li>
</ol>

<p>

By applying this technique to each of the components of completing a purchase,
one can flush out (and handle) nearly all of the different possible errors that
could affect a purchase. Give this technique a try in some critical section of
the code. You&#8217;ll be surprised how well it works. Before giving you the fix to
the above code, let&#8217;s see if we can write unit and feature tests on our error
handling.

<a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/v/2-13/docs/method-stubs">RSpec provides a nice mocking library</a>. The test code would look something like
this. Pay attention to the call to <b>stub</b>.

This test code ensures that the error handling of purchase_cart will catch an
error from fulfill_order, and properly refund the payment and rollback any
changes to the order record.

<p>
Here are the key points to the improved code:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There&#8217;s a block to catch the exception which is <i>separate from the
transaction block</i>. The <code>rescue</code> properly handles the case of an a charge
being made and needing to be refunded. <code>Utility.log_exception</code> will ensure
that all the right things happen with this sort of error (see <a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/05/08/saner-rails-logging/">code for
Utlity.logException</a>).
</li>
<li>fulfill_order is moved outside of the transaction block. This allows the
transaction to complete, and then the order_fulfillment takes place. If
there&#8217;s an issue in fulfilling the order, that can be dealt with separately
from the original charge. In other words, the customer can successfully pay
for the order, and the store can deal with the failure to fulfill the order.

<a href="https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist">Poltergeist</a>. The secret sauce is the same use of the same stubbing technique as
above to replace some key methods such that they throw an exception. This sort
of technique works amazingly well to ensure that application will do the right
then when an unexpected failure occurs, from the logging and emailing of the
error message to the browser display to then end user.

I tend to develop such a test in an iterative manner:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make sure you&#8217;ve got tests on the &#8220;happy&#8221; case where the story goes as
planned.
</li>
<li>Then introduce test cases where have bits of code like this that will raise
an error at an opportune time.
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Order</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">any_instance</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:fulfill_order</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="no">ArgumentError</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;test error&quot;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
</li>
<li>Allow the test cases to fail, and put in screen shots (in Capybara with
phantomjs, that looks like this:
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">render_page</span> <span class="s2">&quot;a-descriptive-name&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<p>
Setup this method <code>render_page</code> in a spec helper file like this:
</p>
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
</li>
<li>Put in some assertions that the page shows the correct error and the records
in the database have the right values.
</li>
<li>You can even
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you aren&#8217;t simulating how your application responds to errors, then you&#8217;ll
eventually find out, and the result might not be as good as you&#8217;d prefer. You
can simulate errors with the very simple and quick technique of a well placed
=raise &#8220;some error&#8221;=, and then testing in a UI. Or you might prefer the
robustness of unit or feature tests using stubbing. Either way, the key message
is to check how your application handles errors, before your customers do.

TLDR: Clean logging and error handling is a critical aspect of a RoR app.
What&#8217;s a good strategy? Why does this matter?
</p>

<p>
A Rails app can have awesome unit and functional tests, and then in production,
something goes wrong and the right error handling does not happen, making
a bad situation worse. By this, I mean, it&#8217;s bad enough that something went
wrong in production. It&#8217;s even worse if:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You don&#8217;t have clear log messages that identify exactly what went wrong.
</li>
<li>You didn&#8217;t get automatically notified via email that something went wrong.
Instead, the customer told the customer service rep that there&#8217;s an issue.
Ideally, when an error happens, the responsible developers should be
notified.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here&#8217;s some tips on logging setup and error handling, including a utility
method to log the stack trace and send an email.
</p>

<p>
The next article,
<a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/05/11/testing-error-handling/">Testing
Error Handling</a>, will show you how to verify that your error handling strategy
is properly implemented, includind with rspec tests.

<h3 id="sec-1-1">Notification of any Exceptions via Email with Gem exception_notification</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Check out the gem <a href="http://smartinez87.github.io/exception_notification/">exception_notification</a>. It works great. One things the docs
don&#8217;t point out is that it works great with <a href="http://mailcatcher.me/">MailCatcher</a>. This allows you to
&#8220;test&#8221; that your exception notification emails are being sent as expected
without using a real mail account. Thus, <i>do</i> enable exception logging in
development mode, contrary to the basic setup. Here&#8217;s a config example at this
post on <a href="http://www.mikeperham.com/2012/12/09/12-gems-of-christmas-4-mailcatcher-and-mail_view/">MailCatcher and mail_view</a>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
The gem <a href="https://github.com/gshutler/browser_details">browser_details</a> will tell you what type of browser was used, which
can be very important when errors occur. I cracked up when I read this from the
gem info page: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Have you ever had the conversation:
</p>

<p>
Your site doesn&#8217;t work.
What browser are you using and do you have Javascript enabled?
</p>

<p>
What&#8217;s a browser?

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Sometimes too much of a good thing (log info) is a bad thing, and that&#8217;s true
with Rails default logging. Check out the gem &#8217;<a href="https://github.com/roidrage/lograge">lograge</a>&#8217;. The big difference is
that a single request will take a single line. To quote the README, instead of
logs like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
Started GET "/" for 127.0.0.1 at 2012-03-10 14:28:14 +0100
Processing by HomeController#index as HTML
  Rendered text template within layouts/application (0.0ms)
  Rendered layouts/_assets.html.erb (2.0ms)
  Rendered layouts/_top.html.erb (2.6ms)
  Rendered layouts/_about.html.erb (0.3ms)
  Rendered layouts/_google_analytics.html.erb (0.4ms)
Completed 200 OK in 79ms (Views: 78.8ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)
</pre>

<p>
After installing lograge, you&#8217;ll have one line for the request:
</p>
<pre class="example">
method=GET path=/jobs/833552.json format=json controller=jobs action=show status=200 duration=58.33 view=40.43 db=15.26
</pre>

<p>
The one issue with <code>lograge</code> is that the default configuration does not log
request parameters, which can be useful for debugging. This blog post, <a href="http://ionrails.com/2013/03/26/how-to-add-the-request-parameters-along-with-full-url-request-in-lograge-outputted-files/">How to add
request parameters to lograge logs</a>, addresses that shortcoming.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Avoid rescuing/catching if you can&#8217;t do anything with the exception. For
example, in a model method, you might be calling that from a controller, but
you also might be calling that from some scheduled job. Thus, it&#8217;s hard to
say what the right action should be. A special case is calling <code>raise</code> without
arguments: sometimes it is reasonable to catch all exceptions, logging the
exception, and then re-raising it like it was never caught.
</li>
<li>If you catch an exception, consider if you should re-throw the exception
because code at a different level will be able to handle the exception more
properly.
</li>
<li>Consider how the code is being invoked, such as from a call to generate
HTML or an ajax request, or maybe a batch job. All of these cases have very
different needs for how the error should be handled.
</li>
<li>Be sure you understand the order of your rescue clauses matter. This article
<a href="http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/posts/rklemme/003-The_Universe_between_begin_and_end.html">The Universe between <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code></a> provides a good explanation.
Basically put the most specific exception types first and something like
<code>rescue =&gt; e</code> last.
</li>
<li>Ruby does not support the concept of a &#8220;cause&#8221; with an exception. Thus, if
you catch an exception and are going to rethrow a different exception, then
it&#8217;s important to log the stack of the original exception, or else that
information will be lost.
</li>
<li>Test the logging of the exception in both development and production mode.
You want to ensure that any exception prints clearly regardless of Rails
environment.
</li>
<li>A good way to test error handling is to temporarily put in <code>raise
   ArgumentError</code> (or whatever other error), and see how the exception is
handled, both by the logger and the UI.
</li>
<li>The worst scenario is catching an exception and failing to log any messages.
This can make troubleshooting a problem very tricky.

Here&#8217;s a few tips on buying Apple gear and credit card extended warranties. The
bottom line is:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Consider buying <b>AppleCare</b> with <b>American Express</b> to get an extended warranty that
extends 12 months past AppleCare&#8217;s 3 years. That&#8217;s 4 years total! Visa and
MasterCard <b>do not</b> extend AppleCare&#8217;s 3 years.
</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t need AppleCare, then try to buy with American Express, as you know you&#8217;ll
still get an extra 12 months. Visa or MasterCard may or may not offer a
warranty extension depending on your card.
</li>
<li>Avoid buying AppleCare with a Visa or MasterCard if the card already has a
warranty extension. You would get 24 months of basic coverage (one year
original plus one year card). For the price of AppleCare, you get only an
extra 12 months, although some will want the telephone question coverage of
AppleCare.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Buy products when they just come out, or wait until the next version comes out.
It seems like Apple products don&#8217;t really go on sale, so you might as well get
the newest stuff, or wait if you can. A good place to check is <a href="http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/">MacRumors Buyers
Guide</a>. That being said, if you need something, then you need it, so just buy
it. If you&#8217;re not sure, then you can probably wait.

In general, you&#8217;d probably be off without extended warranties unless there&#8217;s
something special about your situation that suggest one is worth it. Plus, if
you buy with the right credit card, you&#8217;ll get one year extension, giving you a
full years without paying a cent. Here&#8217;s an article on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5697141/skip-the-extended-warranty-use-a-good-credit-card-instead">LifeHacker: Skip the
Extended Warranty; Use a Good Credit Card Instead</a>. I live on the beach, so
everything tends to rust, so I tend to buy extended warranties for this reason.

<h2 id="sec-3">American Express, not Mastercard, if you buy AppleCare</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Both American Express and Mastercard offer warranty extensions of up to one year for using
their cards. However, there&#8217;s a huge difference in their policies. American Express
specifically states that they extend past supplemental warranty extensions like
AppleCare. MasterCard explicitly says they do not. Visa is ambiguous. I quoted
the details below. American Express will provide up to one year additional for warranties
up to 5 years. MasterCard only goes to one year. Visa goes to 3 years.

I&#8217;ve got the Costco True Earnings card. The details of the plan are
here:<a href="http://www.americanexpress.com/us/content/pdf/card-benefits/TrueEarningsCardfromCostcoandAmericanExpress/EW-DOC-CCSG.pdf">EXTENDED WARRANTY DESCRIPTION OF COVERAGE</a>. Kudos to the American Express for website
for making it easy to find the information (unlike MasterCard).
</p>

<p>
Just to be sure, I found the spot which ensures that I get one year past when
AppleCare ends:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Where a Loss has occurred during this Plan&#8217;s extended warranty time period of up
to one (1) additional year, We will provide a benefit equal to the coverage of
the original manufacturer&#8217;s warranty on warranties of up to five (5) years. We
will pay up to the actual amount charged to Your Account for the product for
which a Loss is claimed, but not to exceed $10,000. If the product also is
covered by a purchased service contract, this Plan’s extended warranty time
period begins at the end of the service contract and extends the original
manufacturer’s warranty for a period of time equal to that warranty, up to one
(1) additional year. If the combined coverage of the original manufacturer’s
warranty and the purchased service contract exceed five (5) years, the product
purchased is not eligible under this Plan and no coverage applies.
</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">MasterCard</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
Your bank&#8217;s website will not have any information about any extended warranty.
You have to go to MasterCard&#8217;s website: <a href="http://www.mastercard.com/us/personal/en/cardholderservices/guidetobenefits/pdf/489247_extended_warranty_v2.pdf">Guide to Benefits EXTENDED WARRANTY
COVERAGE</a>. MasterCard is the stingiest. If the product has more than a one year
warranty, then MasterCard does not help.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&gt; Extended Warranty doubles the original warranty time period and duplicates the coverage of
the original manufacturer’s (or U.S. store brand) warranty up to a maximum of twelve (12)
months on most items you purchase. For products with multiple warranty components,
each warranty time period will be duplicated up to a maximum of twelve (12) months.
Should you fail to properly register the original warranty as required by manufacturer,
Extended Warranty will only double the actual warranty time period that you received from
the manufacturer. An example of a product with multiple warranty components includes an
appliance with original manufacturer’s (or U.S. store brand) warranties that differ for parts,
labor, compressor, etc.
</p>

<p>
&gt; If you purchase a service contract or an optional extended warranty of twelve (12) months
or less on your item, Extended Warranty will cover up to an additional twelve (12) months
after both the original manufacturer’s (or U.S. store brand) warranty and the purchased
service contract or extended warranty coverage period end. If your service contract or
extended warranty exceeds twelve (12) months, this coverage does not apply.
</p>

<p>
&gt; If you do not have an additional service contract or an optional extended warranty, this
Extended Warranty benefit commences the day after your original manufacturer’s (or U.S.
store brand) warranty expires.
</p>

<p>
&gt; If either the original manufacturer’s (or U.S. store brand) warranty or the service contract
covers more than twelve (12) months, Extended Warranty benefits will not apply.

Here&#8217;s the Visa benefits for one type of card: <a href="http://usa.visa.com/business/why-pay-with-visa/security-benefits/bft-purchase-security.html">VISA PURCHASE PROTECTION</a>. Note,
each Visa card may be different. Visa is a lot better than MasterCard in that
if your product has more than a 1 year warranty, Visa still gives you an extra
year.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Extended Protection Yes, as long as you purchased the item entirely with your
eligible U.S.- issued Visa Business card and the eligible item has a valid
original manufacturer’s written U.S. repair warranty or assembler warranty of
three (3) years or less.
