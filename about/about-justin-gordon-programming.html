Here&#8217;s the more detailed version about me. Skim it, read it, let me know what
you think&hellip;
</p>




<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Just a Kid</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>I&#8217;d probably say my first exposure to a computer was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Atari Pong</a>. I was a
little kid, and the game was addictive. After that, I had various Atari video
games, and then started programming on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80">TRS-80</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a>. In high
school, I wrote a database program in PASCAL on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Apple II</a> for the school&#8217;s
college counselor to rank the class by GPA. Shortly after high school, I did
programmed neuroscience simulations on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Computer">Apollo Workstation</a>. I took a break from
computers for a few years, studying applied mathematics at <a href="http://www.college.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do">Harvard College</a>.
</p>
<p>
Part of me regrets a bit that I didn&#8217;t study computer science, but at the time,
I loved learning about so many other subjects, especially math, economics,
statistics, and a vast array of liberal arts topics. 
</p>
</div>

</div>




<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">After College</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>After college, I wrote investment management applications for <a href="http://www.gmo.com/America/">GMO</a>, using 4D
database software, and then investment trading applications for <a href="http://www.mcm.com/">Mellon Capital</a>,
using C++/Sybase/Solaris. My most significant accomplishment at Mellon was
writing a good portion of their Taxable Tactical Asset Allocation system, which
took into account the tax effects of potential asset allocation re-balancing
trades. For example, if you were 70% stocks and 30% bonds, and your stocks had
big gains (big taxes if you sell), would that affect your decision to re-balance
your account to 50% stocks and 50% bonds? This system was used for many years to
manage billions of dollars.
</p>
<p>
In 1996, the Internet took off, and I got recruited to join a classic dot-com,
called Infoscape, that built a Java database tool called &#8220;Fresco&#8221;. I was really
fortunate to have learned Java from Infoscape&#8217;s founder Richard Williamson, who,
until recently, was the head of the new iOS Maps app. That was definitely the
best part about the startup experience. Although Infoscape was recognized by
Upside and Computer World magazines as one of the top 100 emerging technology
companies for 1998, it went bankrupt.
</p>
<p>
In 1998, I left Infoscape to work on a startup idea to automate recruiting
functions at large corporations. That worked out OK, with the assets eventually
getting sold to Extensity, where I had already had gotten recruited with a great
offer as the dot-com frenzy exploded in late 1998 and early 1999. The party
ended in mid-2001, and I had an opportunity to take a breather from the dot-com
craziness and to enjoy finishing up my MBA at <a href="http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley&#8217;s Haas School</a>, where I
had started my MBA part-time while working at Mellon Capital.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Trigo and IBM</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>After my MBA, I joined Trigo, a promising start-up, in 2002. Trigo got sold to
IBM in late 2004, and the product is still going strong. It is currently known
as <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/mdm/collaborative.html">InfoSphere MDM Collaborative Edition</a>. According to Gartner in 2012, in a
report titled <a href="http://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/en/iml14344usen/IML14344USEN.PDF">&#8220;Magic Quadrant for Master Data Management of Product Data Solutions&#8221;</a>, this product is the leader. Pretty cool!
</p>
<p>
So what does this product do? Suppose you&#8217;re a huge retailer with thousands of
suppliers that send you product descriptions, maybe in XML. And you need to
enable your team to check and amend this data, before publishing this data to
your e-commerce site. Now suppose this product information is for a big hardware
store and it includes things as different as lawn mowers and cleaning chemicals.
Suppose you tried to save the data for these two types of products in
conventional SQL tables (remember, this is circa 2002 before no-SQL databases
nor DB support for XML columns). With thousands of product types, standard SQL
tables don&#8217;t work. MDM CE provides a categorization mechanism such that you can
have different product categories with different sets of attributes.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1">Inventing a Storage Mechanism for Product Data</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">

<p>My biggest contribution to the product was my leadership and execution of a
dramatic change in the core storage architecture. Originally, the data in the
product was stored in what&#8217;s known as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model">Entity–attribute–value model</a>. As the
Wikipedia article puts it: &#8220;The Achilles heel of EAV is the difficulty of
working with large volumes of EAV data.&#8221; The team bounced around some ideas of
how we might solve this problem such as storing blobs of XML data. Then we
struck upon the idea of a hierarchical indexed binary representation of the data
akin to how a database or file system works. Around this time, I heard about the
agile approach from John Seybold, the CTO of Guidewire. John especially espoused
the benefits of doing true Test Driven Development, or, as he called it, &#8220;Test
First Programming&#8221;. With an idea and a technique, I took the ball and ran, and
the result was a dramatically improved storage architecture for storing vast
quantities of structured, hierarchical data, which we called &#8220;serialization&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
So how good is the performance of &#8220;serialization&#8221;? Pretty damn good. Good enough
that the performance and reliability have overcome the concerns of many
architects within IBM with the conventional mode of thinking that a small team
could not have built a storage architecture that could compete with products
like IBM&#8217;s DB2 XML. The performance of the &#8220;serialization&#8221; mechanism for reads
is O(N) where N is the depth of the tree. The memory usage is similarly good. There
is only a tiny amount of memory used to navigate the tree. Not only can values
can be read from such a data structure nearly instantly, but the time to write a
value back into the tree is similarly fast. In comparison to DOM parsing of
huge XML documents, and the cost to re-serialize large DOMs, there was simply
no comparison.
</p>
<p>
The use of Test Driven Development was critical for this project. For one, any
errors in the algorithms turned out to be as obscure as working on C/C++ code
due to the nature of the binary manipulations. Then, the original implementation
was slow, which is not surprising in retrospect. A fast arsenal of unit tests,
however, enabled me to make dramatic changes to the internal algorithms to get
the blazing speed needed. It really was like a secret sauce to have used TDD
plus Pair-Programming to develop an awesome test suite, and to use <a href="http://www.yourkit.com/">Yourkit</a> to
profile and optimize.
</p>
<p>
Upon the completion of the storage mechanism, I realized that searching for the
data inside these binary objects was the next major problem. This led to my
patents <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220070244865%22.PGNR.">Method and system for data retrieval using a product information search engine</a> and <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220090210434%22.PGNR.">STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF VARIABLE DATA</a>. The first part is a query
language, similar to SQL, used for finding data. The second part describes the
use of XML database records as shadow copies of the binary storage, which can be
written asynchronously to avoid slowing down realtime reading and writing. This
way we can have our cake and eat it too, with super fast reading-writing of the
structured documents through &#8220;serialization&#8221; plus the ability to query and
export the XML copies of the data.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2">Test Driven Development</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">

<p>The success of Test Driven Development for the &#8220;Serialization&#8221; project led to
management requests for tests against the rest of the system. The hard part of
creating tests was in generating the huge object graphs backed by the database.
This led to my work on the open source project called the <a href="https://github.com/justin808/dof">Dependent Object Framework</a>, This was a huge success within the team in terms of allowing the team
to achieve a reasonable degree of test coverage. With this experience in TDD, I
became a frequent speaker on the topic, having spoken at three Dr. Dobb&#8217;s
conferences on the topic (San Jose, Chicago, and Boston).
</p>
<p>
Here was an abstract of one of the talks:
</p><blockquote>

<p>Dr. Dobbs, Architecture and Design world talk:
THURSDAY, JULY 24, 3:30 PM—5:00 PM, TRACK: ADM s LEVEL: INT, JUNIT AND
TEST-DRIVEN, DEVELOPMENT: WHY AND HOW IN ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE. Justin Gordon. A
comprehensive suite of JUnit tests is the single most important artifact created
in a software project because it reduces bugs, facilitates adding new
developers, and enables refactoring and performance tuning with confidence.
Test-driven development (TDD) is the best way to build a test suite. Justin will
discuss this assertion and address practical issues encountered on test-driven
projects, including: How to get team members to adopt TDD on a project; how to
implement TDD on a project with large amounts of existing untested legacy code,
especially with pervasive database dependencies; design patterns to facilitate
TDD, including mock objects, dependency location, and the Dependent Object
Framework. These techniques solve the difficult technical problems of isolating
code to be tested and setting up required persistent data. After the talk,
Justin will do Q&amp;A and a live, hands-on demo of Test-Driven Development and Pair
Programming. Requirements: Basic Java Programming Experience. Java IDE required,
preferably IntelliJ or Eclipse.
</p>
</blockquote>
