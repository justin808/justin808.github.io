<p>
What are the best-practices for upgrading gems to newer versions? What sort of
tips and techniques can save time and headaches? 
</p>

<p>
I built this guide based on my real-world experiences over years of gem
migrations, including a recent upgrade to Rails 4.1, RSpec 3.0, and Twitter
Bootstrap 3.2. There are some more specific examples of errors you might
encounter at this article on the Rails on Maui blog: <a href="http://railsonmaui-octopress.dev/blog/2014/09/12/specific-issues-upgrading-gems-to-rails-4-dot-1-and-rspec-3/">Specific Issues Upgrading Gems to Rails 4.1, RSpec 3, and Twitter Bootstrap 3.2</a>.

<h2 id="sec-1">Why Update?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Here's my favorite reasons for keeping gems relatively current:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If you work on several projects, keeping the gems and ruby version consistent
makes your coding more productive as you don't have to keep adjusting for
which version is which. Web searches tend to find relatively recent versions
first. It's relatively annoying to be yak shaving issues that turn out to be
"oh, that doesn't work in that older version of Rails".
</li>
<li>Recent versions of gems will have fixes for bugs and security issues, in
addition to new features. With popular open source projects, new bugs are
quickly discovered and fixed.
</li>
<li>Updates are much easier if you stay relatively current. I.e., it's much
easier to update from Rails 4.0 to Rails 4.1 than to go from Rails 3.0 to
Rails 4.1.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
That being said, recent versions can have new bugs, so it's best to avoid
versions that are unreleased or that haven't aged at least a few weeks.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-1-1">Some Gems Will Be Way More Difficult to Update</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Large libraries, like Rails, RSpec, Twitter Bootstrap, etc. are going to take
more elbow grease to update. Typically if a major version number is updating,
like Rails 3.x to 4.x and RSpec 2.x to 3.x, that's going to require lots of code
changes. Semantic versioning also comes into play. Going from Rails 3.x to Rails
4.x is more difficult than Rails 4.0 to Rails 4.1. There's a similar story with
RSpec 2.x to 2.99, compared to going to RSpec 3.0.

<h3 id="sec-2-1">Locking Gem Versions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Unless you have a good reason, don't lock a gem to a specific version as that
makes updating gems more difficult. In general, consider only locking the major
Rails gems, such as rails, RSpec, and bootstrap-sass, as these are the ones that
will likely have more involved upgrades.

<h4 id="sec-2-2-1">3 Reasons to wait a bit before gem updates:</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Dependencies among gem libraries</b> are not yet resolved. I had tried
upgrading to RSpec 3 and Rails 4.1 a couple months ago, but it was
apparent that I had to fix to many other gems to get them to work with <code>RSpec
   3</code>. Thus, I retreated back to RSpec 2.99 for a while. Now, as of August, 2014,
the gem ecosystem was ripe to move to RSpec 3.0. So unless you have a good
reason, it's best to wait maybe a couple of months after major upgrades are
released before migrating.
</li>
<li><b>Bugs</b> may be lurking in changed code. If you wait a bit, the early adopters
will find the bugs, saving you time and frustration. The more popular a gem,
the faster it will be put to rigorous use.
</li>
<li>*Security*/ problems may have been introduced. This is pretty much a special
case of bugs, except that this a possibility of a malicious security change.
If you wait a bit, hopefully somebody else will discover the issue first.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Don't Use Guard, Zeus, Spring, Spork, Etc. When Upgrading</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Tools that speed up Rails like Zeus and Spring are awesome productivity
enhancers, <b>except</b> when upgrading gems. I found that they <i>sometimes</i> correctly
reloaded new versions of gems. That means massive frustration when they are not
picking up the gems you actually have specified. The corollary to this is to run
your tests using plain <code>rspec</code> rather than the recommended ways for speeding up
testing, such as the <code>parallel_tests</code> gem..
</p>

<p>
It's not necessary to introduce the added complexity of the test accelerators
when doing major library updates. Once you've updated your gems, then try out
your favorite techniques for speeding up running tests. I've learned the hard
way on this one. The <code>pgr</code> and <code>pgk</code> scripts below are awesome for ensuring that
pre-loaders are <i><b>NOT</b></i> running.
</p>

{% codeblock lang:bash %}
pgr() {
  for x in spring rails phantomjs zeus; do 
    pgrep -fl $x;
  done 
}

pgk() {
  for x in spring rails phantomjs zeus; do 
    pkill -fl $x;
  done 
}
{% endcodeblock %}

<h3 id="sec-2-4">Tests: Try to Keep and Immediately Get Tests Passing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
There are a lot of discussions about the value or lack of for an emphasis on Test-Driven Development (TDD).
However, one thing that's indisputable is that <i><b>having a large library of tests is absolutely helpful for upgrading your gems</b></i>.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, it's an iterative process to get tests passing when updating gems.
First, make sure your tests suite is passing.
</p>

<p>
You can try updating the gems one by one until you get a test failure. Then the
issue becomes one of figuring out which related gems you might want to update to
fix the test failure.
</p>

<p>
If you don't have good tests coverage, a great place to start is with
integration tests that do the basics of your app. At least you'll be able to
quickly verify a good chunk of your app can at least navigate the "happy path"
as you iterate updating your gems.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-5">Alternate Big or Baby Steps</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
If you've updated gems recently, sometimes you can run <code>bundle update</code> and
everything works great. Recently, that strategy failed miserably when I tried
going from Rails 4.0 with RSpec 2.2 to Rails 4.1 and RSpec 3. An eariler attempt
shortly after the releases of Rails 4.1 and RSpec 3 clearly showed that many
dependent gems would have to get updated. A few months later, I still had many
issues with trying to update too much at once.
</p>

<p>
When this happens, take small steps and kept tests passing. I.e., don't do a
<code>bundle update</code> without specifying which gems to update. You might update 60
gems at once! And then when tests fail, you won't be able to easily decipher
which dependency is the problem. Specify which gems to update by running the
command:
</p>

{% codeblock lang:bash %}
bundle update gem1 gem2 etc
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
Then after updating a few gems, run <code>rspec</code> and verify your tests pass.
</p>

<p>
<b>Then commit your changes.</b> Consider putting a summary of how many tests pass
and how long it takes. The length of time is useful in case some change greatly
increases test run time. Or if you notice run time or the number of tests
dramatically decrease. Plus, this ensures you ran the test before committing!
</p>

<p>
On a related note, you can see which gems are outdated with this command:
<code>bundle outdated</code>.
</p>

<!-- more -->

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-6">Try bundle update</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<p>
Remember I told you not to do a <code>bundle update</code>? Once you're getting closer to
finishing your gem updates, all big gems are updated, and all tests are passing,
and deprecation warnings are addressed, then it's time to run <code>bundle update</code>
and then run <code>rspec</code> to see if your tests pass. If you don't have adequate
tests, then be ready to do some adequate manual testing. Even if you have lots
of tests, you still need to do manual testing if you upgrade a UI library such
as <code>sass-bootstrap</code>. Besides testings, check the bundler output or the diff of
your <code>Gemfile.lock</code> to see what got updated.

<h3 id="sec-3-1">Read Error Messages Carefully and then search Google and Github Issues</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Too often Ruby developers will blindly copy-paste their error messages into a
Google search without really reading the console output carefully. This can
actually waste more time, since thinking about the problem for a moment can
often give you a solution without Google, or you'll write a better search query.
If you don't find what you need on Google and you have an idea what gem is
causing issues, the next place to search is the issues page for the gem's Github
repository.
</p>

<p>
Remember to do these 2 types of searches rather than spending too much time
inserting print statements or launching the debugger! If you don't get any
search hits, then typically you have some problem in app customizations (see
below).

<h3 id="sec-3-2">Visit the Gem Repository on Github</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Some essential places to look at when upgrading gems are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>README.md file (shown on the main page of repository). Some projects might
have a NEWS.md or CHANGELOG.md file.
</li>
<li>The Github issues list for a gem (and search here)
</li>
<li>The Github commit history for a gem, sometimes switching branches.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Errors or deprecation messages can come from compatibility issues among your
gems. The RSpec 3 upgrade had many such issues. If you're having an upgrade
issue, then a concise, detailed post of a new issue typically results in a very
quick response.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-3">Try an RC Version on RubyGems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
Sometimes the fix you need has already been released to RubyGems in an RC
version (RC means Release Candidate). <code>bundle update &lt;gem&gt;</code> seems to not pick RC
versions. You have to specify these manually. I search for gems on RubyGems so
often that I created a Chrome search shortcut. Here's an example of an RC
version gem that I'm currently using:
</p>

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
gem 'simple_form', '>= 3.1.0.rc2'
{% endcodeblock %}
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-4">Try a Github Gem Version Rather Than a RubyGems Version</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
Sometimes what you need has not been shared with RubyGems, yet the issue has
received commits on Github. In that case, you can use the Github version of a gem.
This might be on a specific branch of a gem, or even another user's fork of a
gem.
</p>

<p>
For example, this image shows that the last version bump of the <code>gon</code> gem is
behind several commits.
</p>

{% img /images/2014-08-11-upgrading-to-rails-4-and-rspec-3-with-capybara-and-resque/gon-commits-not-in-gem.jpg %}
</p>

<p>
If you needed those commits post gem release, here's an example of the syntax to
specify the very-latest version of a gem (the tip of the master branch):
</p>

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
gem 'gon', github: "gazay/gon", branch: "master"
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
Sometimes what you need is something less than the most current version, or a
specific branch, or a fork of the gem.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-5">Consider Forking a Gem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-5">
<p>
Sometimes you need to fork a gem for some changes. If you've never done this,
it's a <b>very worthwhile thing to try out</b>, and it's easy! For example, if you
had wanted to update to rspec 3 sooner than later and didn't want to see tons of
deprecation messages, then your only option was to fork the gems that had the
deprecated syntax. Once you've verified the validity of your changes, consider
submitting a pull request. Here's an example of a <a href="https://github.com/justin808/zeus-parallel_tests/commit/ccd7367d4f33ae8940a4205a164df714ccfcb42c">fork and commit of the
zeus-parallel_tests gem that loosened a gem dependency</a>.
</p>

<p>
You should typically prefer a rubygems version of a gem rather than a github
version. Thus, after some months, you should try to remove any previously
necessary github references in your Gemfile.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-6">
<p>
I ran into a case where including rspec-instafail before rspec resulted in zeus
failing due to <code>rspec-instafail</code> failing to recognize that I was using rspec 3.
Simply placing <code>rspec-instafail</code> after loading <code>rspec</code> in the Gemfile fixed that
issue.
</p>

<p>
I had a clue that was the issue due to this stack dump. Note how the bundler is
loading rspec-instafail, and when I looked at the source code, I could see why
file <code>rspec_2.rb</code> was being loaded (2nd line of the below stack dump)

Once I got all tests passing, I tried to update to Rails 4.1, but ran into this
issue:
</p>

<pre class="example">
bundle update rails                                                                                                                                                                                             ✹ ✭ [20:31:38]

    rails (~&gt; 4.1) ruby depends on
      activemodel (4.1.0)
</pre>

<p>
I verify I'm on the current maximum GA version of simple_form, but I find that
there's an RC version, so I specify that in the gemfile. It's important to note
that "bundle update" will tend not to pull in RC versions of gems, which you
sometimes need after major libraries are upgraded.
</p>

<p>
In <code>Gemfile</code>

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
gem 'rails', '~> 4.1'
gem 'simple_form', '>= 3.1.0.rc2'
{% endcodeblock %}

<pre class="example">

Installing simple_form 3.1.0.rc2 (was 3.0.1)

</pre>

<p>
After the 4.1 upgrade, I addressed a number of deprecation warnings.
</p>

<pre class="example">

Then I got this warning with a full stack dump.

<p>
The stack dump was useless, but the search for error message on Google found
<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers/issues/408">this</a> indicating that the issue had something to do with <code>shoulda-matchers</code>. A

</p>

<pre class="example">

<p>
And that fixed that issue!
