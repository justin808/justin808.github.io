<i>Note: This is post applies to Emacs 23 with org-mode 7.8.x. See <a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2014/03/05/octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode-v2/index.html">Org-Mode Octopress Setup v2</a> for the updated version applying to Emacs 24.3 and org-mode 8.2.x</i>

WordPress seemed like a good blogging platform, but it just didn't feel right. I
spend all my day editing text files using vim key-bindings, and I love <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org
Mode</a> for all non-coding writing. If you don't know Org Mode, it's like having
Markdown mode on steroids. You can have a numbered list in Markdown, but
org-mode lets you re-order the list, and that's just the beginning. Editing blog
documents in the WordPress editor felt almost as bad as being told to use MS
Word. I found that ergonomics of Org Mode, including all the goodness of recent
versions of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, including <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil">Evil</a> (Vim emulation), just made organization of
creative thoughts so much more enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
So I bit the bullet one weekend, and dove into <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. You're looking at the
results of this endeavor, including my first Octopress article, and the latest
tips on recreating this sort of blog using Octopress with Org Mode authoring,
using LiveReload, and deployed at no charge on github.com.
</p>

<p>
If you used to writing real web applications, rather than know the intricacies
of a giant monolithic blogging platform, then the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/theme/template/">customization of Octopress</a>
seems so much more straightforward. This is so much more like the Unix
philosophy that so many of us love, which is small and modular, rather than
monolithic.

I like <a href="https://github.com/robdodson/robdodson.github.com/blob/source/source/_posts/2012-04-30-custom-domain-with-octopress-and-github-pages.markdown">Rob Dodson's summary</a> (noting Org Mode plus Emacs):
</p>

> [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) is a blogging framework written by [Brandon Mathis](http://brandonmathis.com/)
([@imathis](https://twitter.com/#!/imathis)) which sits on top of [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). Jekyll is
a static site generator, meaning there's no database associated with your blog. Instead of writing everything in a
WSYWIG linked to MySQL (like Wordpress or Blogger) you produce text files using Markdown which are then converted to
static HTML. There are 3 huge benefits to this approach. First, writing in
Markdown [*org-mode* for Justin] is awesome. Once you learn the
syntax it's incredibly fast and you don't have to spend time playing with a tiny little editor window just to
<s>add</s> *some* **style** to your posts. Second, writing in your favorite text editor is also awesome. I produce
everything in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) [*Emacs* for Justin] and every day I discover new tricks to make the process
better. If you've ever had to write a blog post using one of those horrible little TinyMCE editors you will appreciate
this feature. And lastly, static HTML is *fast*.

<p>
I found it totally neat that I could embed markdown inside the org-mode
document. See below for how this is done.

<li><a href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/04/30/custom-domain-with-octopress-and-github-pages/">Rob Dodson on Octopress</a>: Start off with these instructions from this posting
on April 30th, 2012. There are a few differences worth noting:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You may wish to change the .rvmrc to a .ruby-version file
</li>
<li>Github recommends your deployment repository be named <code>yourname.github.io</code>,
not <code>yourname.github.com</code>.
</li>
<li>After you run <code>rake setup_github_pages</code> and before running <code>rake
      generate</code>, you should run <code>rake install</code>. If you forget, there's a clear
message indicating this omission.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Customize <code>octopress/_config.yml</code>. The yaml file contains descriptions.
</li>
<li>Update the DNS to use your custom domain if you wish: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages">Github directions on
setting up a custom domain</a>
</li>
<li>At this point, you can create a post:
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
rake new_post["my post name"]
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
Create a page:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
rake new_page["my page name"]
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
Generate and deploy:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
rake gen_deploy
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
Watch the site and regenerate when it changes:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
rake watch
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
Preview the site in a web browser:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
rake preview
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
See all the available rake options:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
rake -T
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
Save changes to source branch:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
git add .
git commit -m "save changes to source"
git push origin source
{% endcodeblock %}

</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>File is located in =source/_posts.

<li>File has a header containing the meta-data for the post. The post URL and

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">POW</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
POW allows you to point your browser to <code>http://octopress.dev</code> to see your local,
unpublished Octopress website. It's very convenient to not have to remember to
run a local server, and it works great with LiveReload. Scroll to the bottom of
this link for details on <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/">POW</a>. The alternative to running POW is to run <code>rake
preview</code> and then point your browser at <code>http://0.0.0.0:4000</code> (or whatever port
you configured).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">LiveReload</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
LiveReload is a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en">Chrome browser extension</a> that will automatically refresh
the browser after you publish your file. This works with or without POW.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-">Install the browser extension</a> for your type of browser.
</li>
<li>Add these two entries to your <code>Gemfile</code>, in the :development group:
{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
gem 'guard'
gem 'guard-livereload'
{% endcodeblock %}
</li>

<li>Create a file called <code>Guardfile</code> containing something like:
{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
guard 'livereload' do
  watch(%r{public/generated})
  watch(%r{public/.+\.(css|js|html)})
end
{% endcodeblock %}
</li>

<li>Start 2 shell tabs running these commands: <code>rake generate &amp;&amp; rake watch</code>
and <code>guard</code>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
> rake generate && rake watch
{% endcodeblock %}
<p>
This screen shot shows <code>watch</code> updating the deployment files.
{% img /images/2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/rake-generate-watch.png %}
start guard LiveReload
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
> guard
{% endcodeblock %}
<p>
This screen grab shows guard detecting the browser and telling the
browser to update.
{% img /images/2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/guard-console.png %}
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's neat to get LiveReload working with Octopress. However, the generation can
finish after your page does a reload, so you won't see your latest changes. I'll
update this blog post when I figure out a solution to that one. Until then, you
may find it more convenient to manually refresh the blog page yourself.
</p>

<p>
It's worth noting that if you're running any other instance of guard-
LiveReload, then one of these two copies will win and one won't work. If you
run a rails server this way, then this can bite you. It took me a bit of time
to figure out why guard wasn't working.

<p>
<a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a> offers quite a bit more than plain markdown. It's quite the <b>hacker's
delight</b> for note taking and authoring of blog articles. Down below I list a few
reasons why org-mode. Here's a few org-mode features I love (Some are Emacs
ones):
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All headers and list items can be reordered with minimal keystrokes (think
super powerful outliner).
</li>
<li>Numbered lists.
</li>
<li>Editable tables in text editor, with movable columns, movable rows.
</li>
<li>Ergonomics of insertion of URLs and images.
</li>
<li>Includes the basics of markdown, such as source code blocks and much more.

<h3 id="sec-5-2">Org-mode Integration</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
I found a plugin that automates the process of converting an org-mode document
(<code>.org</code> file) in <code>source/org_posts</code> into a <code>.markdown</code> document in
<code>source/_posts</code>. Once the markdown document is saved in _posts, the <code>rake
watch</code> task picks up the change and deploys the file, and LiveReload can then
automatically update your web browser. <b>Neat!</b>
</p>

<p>
Here are the basic steps:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Follow the instructions here: <a href="http://blog.paphus.com/blog/2012/08/01/introducing-octopress-blogging-for-org-mode/">Introducing Octopress Blogging for Org-Mode</a>
</li>
<li>At the time of this article, April 27, there's a bug with the latest
org-mode. <a href="https://github.com/craftkiller/orgmode-octopress/issues/3">I posted a workaround.</a> By the time you read this, you probably
won't need that tip.
</li>
<li>You can embed Markdown (or other Octopress/Jekyll directives) by embedding
inside of a <code>#+begin_html</code> and <code>#+end_html</code> block.
{% img /images/2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/quoting-markdown-in-org-mode.png %}
</li>
<li><del>Images work fine.</del> Well, almost fine. The big gotcha is that the standard
inclusion of images in org-mode results in broken paths at deployment. The
workaround is to embed the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/image-tag/">Octopress syntax for an image</a>, and to place the
images under source/images. Note, you'll want to be sure to use an absolute
path, or else your article might look OK on the home page, but might now work
in the postings directory. If I'm creating a document with many images, I'll
group the images for that document in a sub-directory of images named like
the document. This is how it should look. The trick is to place the
octopress <code>img</code> directive within a HTML begin/end block.

<p>

</p>
</li>
<li><b>Links</b>: Links for relative pages are simple.
<pre class="example">
[[file:telecommuting.html][Why telecommuting works and how I maximize productivity]]
</pre>
<p>
Links from a <i>page</i> to a <i>post</i> can use a relative link like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[file:../blog/2013/04/27/octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/index.html][here]]
</pre>
<p>
<b>However</b>, links from posts to other posts require an absolute URL. The big
gotcha is blog posts due to the nested URL structure that does not map to the
where you're putting your org-posts. To avoid trouble, you need to follow a
format as this example shows. It's easiest to copy the URL from the browser
address bar.
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/05/08/strategies-for-rails-logging-and-error-handling/][Strategies for Rails Logging and Error Handling]]
</pre>
<p>
I tried using a <code>file:../blog</code> syntax, but that either would work on the home
page or in the specific blog article, but not both. <code>http:/blog</code> links would
work in Chrome but not mobile Safari. Markdown to get parsed by Jekyll does
not work if the link is within a block level html tag (i.e., a paragraph).
Hopefully, one day we'll be able to specify relative links from blog article
to blog article.
</p>
</li>
<li>Bold styling (text inside of stars) was a bit of mystery using the standard theme. I had to add
this line to _typography.scss:
{% codeblock lang:css %}
b { font-weight: bold; }
{% endcodeblock %}
<p>
Code styling (text inside of equals) <code>like this</code> did not work after a code block unless I added
the <code>div</code> tag to this line around 100 in <code>_syntax.scss</code>
</p>
{% codeblock lang:css %}
// Sometimes html gen by org-mode misses p or li tags
div, p, li {
  code {
    @extend .mono;
{% endcodeblock %}

<h2 id="sec-7">Deploying to Github: Directory Structure of Octopress and the master and source Git Branches</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
Github offers free hosting of both the blog deployment and source. You're
looking at the deployment right now. You can find the source here at
<a href="https://github.com/justin808/justin808.github.io">my git repo justin808.github.io</a>. I doubt you could beat the price, performance, and
convenience. You can look inside of this repo, clone it, etc. and you have
everything that it took to make this blog.
</p>

<p>
I originally was quite confused by the concept of using two separate git
branches to make up what gets deployed on the live website versus the git
repository of my articles. Plus, there's the issue of Octopress git repository
that you clone when starting out. Eventually, I figured out that the two branches
simply contain different files, with one containing the original Octopress
files. Here's a few screen grabs that might clarify the situation for you.
</p>

<p>
Don't forget that you never push to the master branch, but rather the <code>rake
deploy</code> task does it for you. Instead, you run <code>git push origin source</code> to push
the content of your blog to github.
</p>

<p>
The <code>octopress/public</code> directory corresponds to what you'll find on the github
site for your deployment (master branch).
</p>

<p>
{% img /images/2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/public-dir-corresponds-master-branch.png %}
</p>

<p>
The octopress/.gitignore file contains entries like <code>public</code>, which essentially
keeps the <code>rake generate</code> files out of the source branch.
</p>

<p>
Here's the github master branch right after creation. Note the correspondence
with <code>public</code>. This is what gets deployed as your blog.
{% img /images/2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/github-master-branch.png %}
</p>

<p>
Here's the github source branch. This contains the octopress environment, as
well as your customizations and blog posts.
