<p>
<i>Note: This is a refresh of my original post from April, 2013 to adjust for Emacs 24.3 and org-mode 8.2.x</i>
</p>

<p>
WordPress seemed like a good blogging platform, but it just didn't feel right. I
spend all my day editing text files using vim key-bindings, and I love <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a>
for all non-coding writing. If you don't know Org Mode, it's like having
Markdown mode on steroids. You can have a numbered list in Markdown, but
org-mode lets you re-order the list, and that's just the beginning. Editing blog
documents in the WordPress editor felt almost as bad as being told to use MS
Word. I found that ergonomics of Org Mode, including all the goodness of recent
versions of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, including <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil">Evil</a> (Vim emulation), just made organization of
creative thoughts so much more enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
So I bit the bullet one weekend, and dove into <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, publishing my first
article, <a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/04/27/octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/">Octopress Setup with Github, Org Mode, and LiveReload</a>. The solution
presented in that article <a href="http://blog.paphus.com/blog/2012/08/01/introducing-octopress-blogging-for-org-mode/">Introducing Octopress Blogging for Org-Mode</a> stopped
working when I upgraded Emacs to 24.3 and org-mode to 8.2.x. Here's a rehash of
my original article updated to the latest software versions as of March, 2014.
</p>

<p>
If you used to writing real web applications, rather than know the intricacies
of a giant monolithic blogging platform, then the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/theme/template/">customization of Octopress</a>
seems so much more straightforward. This is so much more like the Unix
philosophy that so many of us love, which is small and modular, rather than
monolithic.

I like <a href="https://github.com/robdodson/robdodson.github.com/blob/source/source/_posts/2012-04-30-custom-domain-with-octopress-and-github-pages.markdown">Rob Dodson's summary</a> (noting Org Mode plus Emacs):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> is a blogging framework written by <a href="http://brandonmathis.com/">Brandon Mathis</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/imathis">@imathis</a>) which
sits on top of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a static site generator, meaning there's no
database associated with your blog. Instead of writing everything in a WSYWIG
linked to MySQL (like Wordpress or Blogger) you produce text files using
Markdown which are then converted to static HTML. There are 3 huge benefits to
this approach. First, writing in Markdown (<b>org-mode</b> for me) is awesome. Once
you learn the syntax it's incredibly fast and you don't have to spend time
playing with a tiny little editor window just to add <i>some</i> <b>style</b> to your
posts. Second, writing in your favorite text editor is also awesome. I produce
everything in Sublime Text 2 (<b>Emacs</b> for me) and every day I discover new
tricks to make the process better. If you've ever had to write a blog post
using one of those horrible little TinyMCE editors you will appreciate this
feature. And lastly, static HTML is <b>fast</b>.

This article should be useful for:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Any interest in using org-mode to publish to Octopress including some
reasons I use Org Mode (with Emacs).
</li>
<li>Some explanation of what Octopress and git are doing.
</li>
<li>Anybody curious about how using free github pages works to host Octopress.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Incidentally, since my blog is hosted using github pages, the source code and
configuration I use to generate it can all be found <a href="https://github.com/justin808/justin808.github.io">here</a>. See the notes below on
the difference between the <code>source</code> and <code>master</code> branches.

<li><a href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/04/30/custom-domain-with-octopress-and-github-pages/">Rob Dodson on Octopress</a>: Start off with these instructions from this posting
on April 30th, 2012. There are a few differences worth noting:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You should change the .rvmrc to a .ruby-version file
</li>
<li>Github recommends your deployment repository be named <code>yourname.github.io</code>,
not <code>yourname.github.com</code>.
</li>
<li>After you run <code>rake setup_github_pages</code> and before running <code>rake
      generate</code>, you should run <code>rake install</code>. If you forget, there's a clear
message indicating this omission.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Customize <code>octopress/_config.yml</code>. The yaml file contains descriptions.
</li>
<li>Update the DNS to use your custom domain if you wish: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages">Github directions on

</li>
<li>At this point, you can create a post:
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
rake new_post["my post name"]
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
Create a page:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
rake new_page["my page name"]

<p>
Generate and deploy:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
rake gen_deploy

<p>
Watch the site and regenerate when it changes:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
rake watch
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
Preview the site in a web browser:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
rake preview
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
See all the available rake options:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
rake -T

Save changes to source branch:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
git add .
git commit -m "save changes to source"
git push origin source

<li>File has a header containing the meta-data for the post. The post URL and

POW allows you to point your browser to <code>http://octopress.dev</code> to see your local,

run a local server, and it works great with LiveReload. Scroll to the bottom of
this link for details on <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/">POW</a>. The alternative to running POW is to run <code>rake

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
<a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a> offers quite a bit more than plain markdown. It's quite the <b>hacker's
delight</b> for note taking and authoring of blog articles. Down below I list a few
reasons why org-mode. Here's a few org-mode features I love (Some are Emacs
ones):
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All headers and list items can be reordered with minimal keystrokes (think
super powerful outliner).
</li>
<li>Numbered lists.
</li>
<li>Editable tables in text editor, with movable columns, movable rows.
</li>
<li>Ergonomics of insertion of URLs and images.
</li>
<li>Includes the basics of markdown, such as source code blocks and much more.

</ol>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-2">Org-mode Integration</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress">org-octopress</a> plugin automates the process of converting an org-mode
document (<code>.org</code> file) in <code>source/org_posts</code> into a <code>.html</code> document in
<code>source/_posts</code>. Once the html document is saved in _posts, the <code>rake watch</code>
task picks up the change and deploys the file. <b>Neat!</b>
</p>

<p>
Here are the basic steps:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Install Emacs 24.3 and use the package manager to install org-mode and
   <a href="https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress">org-octopress</a>.
</li>
<li>See my Emacs configuration below.
</li>
<li>Note, there are two ways to use org-octopress. I do not use its features to
automate the setup of the directories. This automated setup does not provide
a way to have "pages". As of March, 2014, you can only have "posts". Instead,
my configuration below handles the mapping of directories.
</li>
<li><del>Images work fine.</del> Well, almost fine. The big gotcha is that the standard
inclusion of images in org-mode results in broken paths at deployment. The
workaround is to embed the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/image-tag/">Octopress syntax for an image</a>, and to place the
images under source/images. Note, you'll want to be sure to use an absolute
path, or else your article might look OK on the home page, but might now work
in the postings directory. If I'm creating a document with many images, I'll
group the images for that document in a sub-directory of images named like
the document. This is how it should look. The trick is to place the
octopress <code>img</code> directive within a HTML begin/end block.

<p>
{% img /images/2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/org-mode-images.png %}
</p>
</li>
<li><b>Links</b>: This is key thing to get right. It's critical to understand the
issues links, or else you'll have one of these issues:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Links work when you test your blog locally using <code>pow</code>, but not when you
go to your published website. This happens if you use a relative link from
blog articles, because blog articles sometimes appear on your home page
and sometimes under the <code>/blog</code> directory. You have to use your domain
address to link from blog articles to other articles on your blog.
</li>
<li>You'd like your local links to point to the correct local spot. You can do
this for links on static pages, but just not blog articles. Thus, for
non-blog articles, it's preferable to use the <code>file:</code> relative path format
(just not <code>file:/</code> absolute path and not <code>file:~/</code>).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Here's the rules:</b>
</p>

<p>
Links from static pages, relatively specified to other static pages and to
posts. Ensure that there's no <code>/</code> immediately following <code>file:</code>. For example:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[file:telecommuting.html][Why telecommuting works and how I maximize productivity]]
</pre>
<p>
Or if the link is one level under the current directory:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[file:misc/telecommuting.html][Why telecommuting works and how I maximize productivity]]
</pre>
<p>
Links from a <i>page</i> to a <i>post</i> can use a relative link like this.
<i>Important: you must use the <code>YYYY/MM/DD/blog-title/index.html</code> format! and you must specify the article title.</i>
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[file:../blog/2013/04/27/octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/index.html][Org-Mode Octopress Setup V2]]
</pre>
<p>
<b>However</b>, links from posts to other posts require an absolute URL using your
published domain name. The big gotcha is that blog posts sometimes are shown
on the home page and sometimes inside of the blog directory. To avoid
trouble, you need to follow a format as this example shows. It's easiest to
copy the URL from the browser address bar.
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/05/08/strategies-for-rails-logging-and-error-handling/][Strategies for Rails Logging and Error Handling]]
</pre>
<p>
I tried using a <code>file:../blog</code> syntax, but that either would work on the home
page or in the specific blog article, but not both. <code>http:/blog</code> links would
work in Chrome but not mobile Safari. Hopefully, one day we'll be able to
specify relative links from blog article to blog article. <i>For now, this is a
big <b>gotcha</b>.</i>
<b>Tip</b>: You can specify relative links between org pages using the <code>.org</code> file
suffix, rather than html. The earlier example could have been specified as:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[file:misc/telecommuting.org][Why telecommuting works and how I maximize productivity]]
</pre>
<p>
That allows you to put your cursor on the link in emacs, and hit F12 to go
the org file! I've got <code>F12</code> mapped to <code>org-open-at-point</code>. Awesome!
</p>
</li>
<li>Bold and italic styling (text inside of stars and /) was a bit of mystery
using the standard theme. Octopress has styling for <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>. Org-mode spits out <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tags.
Add this to <code>sass/custom/_fonts.scss</code>.
{% codeblock lang:css %}
b { font-weight: bold; }
i { font-style: italic; }
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
Code styling (text inside of equals) <code>like this</code> did not work after a code block unless I added
the <code>div</code> tag to this line around 100 in <code>_syntax.scss</code>. You're just adding
the <code>div</code> selector.
</p>
{% codeblock lang:css %}
// Sometimes html gen by org-mode misses p or li tags, so add div to the mix
div, p, li {
  code {
    @extend .mono;
{% endcodeblock %}

<h2 id="sec-8">Deploying to Github: Directory Structure of Octopress and the master and source Git Branches</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
Github offers free hosting of both the blog deployment and source. You're
looking at the deployment right now. You can find the source here at
<a href="https://github.com/justin808/justin808.github.io">my git repo justin808.github.io</a>. I doubt you could beat the price, performance, and
convenience. You can look inside of this repo, clone it, etc. and you have
everything that it took to make this blog.
</p>

<p>
I originally was quite confused by the concept of using two separate git
branches to make up what gets deployed on the live website versus the git
repository of my articles. Plus, there's the issue of Octopress git repository
that you clone when starting out. Eventually, I figured out that the two branches
simply contain different files, with one containing the original Octopress
files. Here's a few screen grabs that might clarify the situation for you.
</p>

<p>
Don't forget that you never push to the master branch, but rather the <code>rake
deploy</code> task does it for you. Instead, you run <code>git push origin source</code> to push
the content of your blog to github.
</p>

<p>
The <code>octopress/public</code> directory corresponds to what you'll find on the github
site for your deployment (master branch).
</p>

<p>
{% img /images/2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/public-dir-corresponds-master-branch.png %}
</p>

<p>
The octopress/.gitignore file contains entries like <code>public</code>, which essentially
keeps the <code>rake generate</code> files out of the source branch.
</p>

<p>
Here's the github master branch right after creation. Note the correspondence
with <code>public</code>. This is what gets deployed as your blog.
{% img /images/2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/github-master-branch.png %}
</p>

<p>
Here's the github source branch. This contains the octopress environment, as
well as your customizations and blog posts.
