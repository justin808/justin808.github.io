<p>
One of the criticisms of Octopress is how there's no clear separation of the static
generation engine and the content of one's website, and thus upgrading Octopress
is difficult. I delayed upgrading due to this. However, my concerns were
unfounded, as it was very painless to upgrade Octopress.
</p>

<p>
The instructions boil down to this short help page on <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/updating/">Updating Octopress</a>:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
git pull octopress master     # Get the latest Octopress
bundle install                # Keep gems updated
rake update_source            # update the template's source
rake update_style             # update the template's style
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
The first step resulted in a few merge conflicts. I find RubyMine's git conflict
resolution tools helpful, so I used those. Here's a short <a href="http://youtu.be/x74Gd2lDC1A">screencast</a> (embedded
below) showing you how these tools helped with this process. Besides some minor
issues dealing with a few merge conflicts, there was nothing very interesting or
eventful about the upgrade, which means that the current process is really quite
OK.

I hope a few people find this demo of the RubyMine git conflict resolution tool
helpful. The key takeaways from this video are:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Merge conflicts show up as red in the list of changes.

</li>

<li>Try the diff'ing buttons in the upper left to get 2 way views of
the 3 way merge.
{% img /images/2013-09-15-upgrading-octopress/merge-window.jpg %}
</li>
</ol>

<p>
3, "Yours" means your local changes, and "Theirs" means the server's changes,
   or, in this case, the changes in the main Octopress development branch.
</p>

<p>
Did the upgrade work? You're looking at the results of it.
</p>

<p>
It's worth noting that I had one slight snag. When I merged sass/screen.scss, I
accidentally removed this line, which is used for the youtube plugin.
</p>
{% codeblock lang:scss %}
@import "custom/rve";
{% endcodeblock %}
<p>
I could have figured this out by examining the history of the file and noting
that I had added this line, rather than it being part of Octopress. So yes, it
would be bit better if there was a cleaner separation between the Octopress
code and any enhancements. However, the current mechanism works, and it's still
thousands of times better than WordPress.
