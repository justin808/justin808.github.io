I updated my previous post <a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/05/26/ember-dot-js-hello-world/">Ember.js Hello World</a> with a video walkthrough of the
<a href="https://github.com/justin808/ember-js-guides-railsonmaui-no-rest">completed code found on github</a> of the <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/">Tom Dale's Intro Tutorial Video</a> on
EmberJs.
</p>

<p>

boing boing: <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/06/27/can-we-talk.html">Can we talk?</a>.
