<p>
What's faster? <a href="https://github.com/burke/zeus">Zeus</a> with <a href="https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests">Parallel Tests</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rails/spring">Spring</a>, in the context of Rails 4.1,
RSpec 3, Capybara 2.4, and PhantomJs?
</p>

<p>
<b>The bottom line is that both work almost equivalently as fast, and the biggest
difference for me concerned compatibility with the parallel_tests gem.</b> Zeus
works fine with Parallel Tests, although it makes little difference overall with
or without Zeus. Spring doesn't work with Parallel Tests, but you can work
around this issue. So stick with Zeus if it works for you.
</p>

<p>
And regardless of using Spring or Zeus, the shell scripts provided below called
<code>pgr</code> and <code>pgk</code> are essential for quickly listing or killing Zeus, Spring,
Rails, or Phantomjs processes!
</p>

<p>
It's also worth noting that biggest advantage of using the Zeus or Spring
pre-loaders is to save the Rails startup time. On my machine, this is about 3 to
5 seconds. That matters a lot if the test I'm focusing upon only takes a second or
two, such as when doing TDD. However, when running a whole test suite taking
minutes, 3-5 seconds can get swallowed up by other things, such as rspec-retry,
which retries failing capybara tests.

<h2 id="sec-1">Overview</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I've written about my integration testing setup: <a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/tips/rails/capybara-phantomjs-poltergeist-rspec-rails-tips.html">Capybara, PhantomJs, Poltergeist, and Rspec Tips</a>. For a while, I've been eager to upgrade to Rails
4.1 and RSpec 3. Finally, in August, 2014, the gem ecosystem allowed this to
happen! I've got a related article on my <a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2014/08/11/upgrading-to-rails-4-and-rspec-3-with-capybara-and-resque/">tips for upgrading to Rails 4.1 and RSpec 3</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once I had upgraded nearly every gem in my client's large Rails project to the
latest gem versions, I was pleasantly surprised that I could once again get
Zeus, Guard, RSpec, Capybara, Poltergeist, Parallel Tests, etc. to all play
nicely together.
</p>

<p>
Always curious as to the value of the latest defaults in Rails, I decided to try
out Spring. Both Spring and Zeus preload Rails so that you don't have to pay the
same start up cost for evry test run. Here's a RailsCast on the topic: <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/412-fast-rails-commands">#412 Fast Rails Commands</a>.
</p>

<p>
The end results is that both Zeus and Spring give great results and are very
similar in many ways. The biggest difference for me is that only Zeus (and not
Spring) works with Parallel Tests. Interestingly, I got very similar results
when using Parallel Tests with our without Zeus. It turns out that it is
possible to run Parallel Tests with Spring installed so long as you disable it
by setting the environment variable like this: <code>DISABLE_SPRING=TRUE parallel_rspec -n 6 spec</code>.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line for me is that I don't have any good reason to move away from
Zeus to Spring, and the fact that Spring is part of stock Rails is not a
sufficient reason for me. That being said, on another project which is smaller,
I'm not motivated to switch from Spring to Zeus.

<h2 id="sec-2">Performance</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Note in below commands, one must insert <code>zeus</code> in the command to be using zeus.
If using Spring, be sure that you're using the Spring modifed binstub scripts in
your bin directory by having your path appropriately set or using <code>bin/rake</code> and
<code>bin/rspec</code> (install <a href="https://github.com/jonleighton/spring-commands-rspec">spring-commands-rspec</a>).
</p>

<p>
The times shown below are from both sample runs of a single directory of
non-integration specs and from the full test suite of 914 tests, many of which
are Capybara tests, on a 2012, Retina, SSD, 16 GB, MacBook Pro while running
Emacs, RubyMine, Chrome, etc. Times were gathered by running commands prefixed
with the <code>time</code> command. Running <code>zeus rspec</code> seems a bit slower than using
spring. However, when running the integration tests, my test execution time was
always variable depending on the number of Capybara timeouts and retries.

<p>
Here's some advantages and disadvantages of using either either Zeus or Spring
compared to plain RSpec.

<h3 id="sec-3-1">Advantages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Both save time for running basic commands like rspec, rake, rails, etc. The
performance of both is very similar.
</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2">Disadvantages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Both can be extremely confusing when they fail to update automatically.</b>
This tends to happen after updating gems or running database migrations. You
end up yak shaving when you don't see your changes taking effect! I.e., put
in some print statements, and then you don't see them shown when they should.
Arghhhh!
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/y310/rspec-retry">Rspec-retry</a> seems essential in dealing with random Capybabara failures with
either Zeus or Spring. I often see less of these errors when I don't use
Zeus/Spring nor parallel_tests.

<h3 id="sec-4-1">Advantages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a href="https://github.com/burke/zeus">Zeus</a> works with the <a href="https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests">parallel_tests gem</a>. This more than halves my time for
running my entire test suite. However, when writing this article, I found
that it made little difference, at least when slowed down by sporadically
failing capybara tests that are retried. That being said, I'm certain that
Parallel Tests with Zeus is faster or at worse the same as without Zeus.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">Disadvantages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You need to start up separate shell process, running <code>zeus start</code>. An
advantage of this is that if there's a problem starting up, the output in the
Zeus console window is fairly clear.
</li>
<li>You run the command "zeus rake" rather than just "rake". Consequently, I made
some shell aliases (see below).
</li>
<li>Zeus only uses the environment from when Zeus was started and ignores any
environment variables when commands are run.

<li><a href="https://github.com/rails/spring">Spring</a> is a default part of Rails, so you know it's well supported, and bugs

<h3 id="sec-5-2">Disadvantages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Spring lacks support for parallel_tests. See this Github issue: <a href="https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests/issues/309#issuecomment-45056130">incompatible
with spring #309</a>. You can, however run parallel_tests so long as run the
command like this: <code>time DISABLE_SPRING=TRUE parallel_rspec -n 6 spec</code>. I.e.,
you need to set <code>DISABLE_SPRING</code> so that parallel_rspec does not use Spring.
</li>
<li>Spring is a bit opaque in terms of errors given there's no console window.
See <a href="https://github.com/rails/spring">README</a> for how to see the Spring log.

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Miscellaneous Tips</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Be sure to disable either Zeus or Spring when updating gems. Consider restarting
Zeus or Spring after a database migration. See the below scripts called <code>pgr</code>
and <code>pgk</code> for seeing and killing Zeus/Spring related processes.

The right combination of gems seem pretty critical in getting all the parts to
play nicely together. As of August 15, 2014 the most recent compatible versions
of the following gems worked well together. This means running "bundle update"
without locking the gem versions.
