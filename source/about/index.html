<p>
I have been passionately writing software since 1985, focusing on Java since
1996 at several startups and with Ruby on Rails since 2011. 
</p>

<p>
My consulting practice has grown. Here's the story: <a href="http://www.shakacode.com/2015/09/17/who-is-shaka-code.html">Who is ShakaCode?</a>
</p>

<p>
Please contact me at <a href="mailto:justin@shakacode.com">justin@shakacode.com</a> if you're interested in Rails
consulting. This blog is created using Octopress, as described <a href="../blog/2013/04/27/octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/index.html">here</a>.

<li>I use ideaVim inside of RubyMine and IntelliJ and Evil (vim) mode inside of

<a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/mdm/collaborative.html">InfoSphere MDM Collaborative Edition</a>. This involved tons of TDD along with
tons of experience optimizing Java code in Yourkit, and inventing clever time
and space solutions, including binary data stores and distributed caching.</li>

Amazon EC2, jQuery, coffeescript, haml, sass, etc.</li>
<li>Close connections to the Jetbrains team and expert with their tools: IntelliJ and RubyMine.</li>

Besides writing great software, Justin enjoys the ocean sports found in Maui,
and has done quite a bit of home improvement, having designed and built the
Sugar Ranch, a B&amp;B (pending application) where he lives with his family. You can
