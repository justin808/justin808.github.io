<p>
I'm a huge fan of the integration tests on Rails. Yes, they can be a bit slow,
and they can be bit difficult to write and maintain, but these disadvantages far
outweigh the comfort in being able to deploy code with no QA staff. This page
will summarize my tips for successful integration testing on Rails. I'll try to
keep this page updated with my current best setup. I look forward to your comments.

<p>
Here are the gems I'm currently using for testing. I'm using an two test
environments: test and ci. The reason for two is that I've got guard constantly
running specs, and sometimes I use a debugger. If guard and the debugger use the
same database, then hangs occur due to transaction issues with database cleaner.

<h2 id="sec-2">Using :focus with guard-rspec</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
My favorite way to run specs is using <a href="https://github.com/burke/zeus">Zeus</a>, <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">Guard</a>, and finally with
<a href="https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests">parallel_tests</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here's the part of my Guardfile for my <code>spec</code> group:
</p>

<p>
{% gist 9461114 %}
</p>

<p>
Here's my workflow for refining a test, and then running all tests in parallel:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Flag test (either <code>describe</code>, <code>context</code>, <code>it</code>, <code>feature</code>, or <code>scenario</code>)
with <code>:focus</code> like this:
{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
feature "Users", :js, :focus do
scenario "signup failure should not make a new user", :focus do
{% endcodeblock %}
</li>
<li>In guard console for your specs, run command <code>a</code> for all tests (or just hit
return). That will run only the tests you've marked with <code>:focus</code>.
</li>
<li>Sometimes guard picks up the changes and re-runs your test automatically.
Many times, I just cmd-tab to iterm2 and hit return, which runs the default
command of all specs.
</li>
<li>Be sure to search and replace for ", :focus" so that you can run the whole
test suite. If you forget to remove a :focus, then you'll
see that the total number of tests is less than you expect.
</li>
<li>Once your new tests pass, run the whole test suite in parallel with the
command <code>zps</code>, defined below.    
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Debugging Integration (aka Feature) Tests</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>First, try to manually do test actions in the browser.
</li>
<li>Test out your CSS and xpath selectors in the chrome console.
a. <code>$("css selector")</code>
b. <code>$x("xpath-selector")</code> 
</li>
<li>Call <code>page!</code> in your test right before the error and a browser will
open up with the page contents.
</li>
<li>Call render_page("some_name", true) to print out a screenshot. Usually,
either the <code>html</code> or the <code>png</code> version of a page will tell you where your
integration test is losing the plot.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here's a couple convenient helper methods, page! and render_page:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def page!
  save_and_open_page
end

# Saves page to place specfied at in configuration.
# NOTE: you must pass js: true for the feature definition (or else you'll see that render doesn't exist!)
# call force = true, or set ENV[RENDER_SCREENSHOTS] == 'YES'
def render_page(name, force = false)
  if force || (ENV['RENDER_SCREENSHOTS'] == 'YES')
    path = File.join Rails.application.config.integration_test_render_dir, "#{name}.png"
    page.driver.render(path)
  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1">Xpath</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Sometimes a Capybara test requires an xpath for more advanced finding of just
the right dom node. For example, here's a useful xpath snippet for finding the xpath to the page one link.
</p>

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
page_1 = find(:xpath, '//div[contains(@class,"pagination")]//a[normalize-space(.)="1"]')
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
If you use a context ("within"), then be sure to use ".//" and not "<i>/" as "/</i>" means
anywhere on the page, not just in the current context!
</p>

<p>
Another case where I had to use an xpath was to find the parent of a node. While
the Capybara node object has a method <code>parent</code>, that does not give you the same
sort of dome node parent that jQuery would. Thus, you can use an xpath like
this, which finds an anchor with attribute <code>data-something</code> having value in ruby
variable <code>data_value</code>.
</p>

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
the_node = find(:xpath, "//a[@data-something='#{data_value}']/..")
{% endcodeblock %}

<h3 id="sec-3-2">Debugger vs. Print Statements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
80% of the time, I use print statements for debugging, rather than the awesome RubyMine
debugger. Here are the pros and cons of each:
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-3">Print Statements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Very fast to see exactly the data you need.
</li>
<li>No issues with multiple threads when running integration tests.
</li>
<li>Print statements help with the coffeescript code. Just do a:
{% codeblock lang:coffeescript %}
console.log "some message, my_var #{my_var}"
{% endcodeblock %}
</li>
<li>With Zeus running, it's much faster to re-run a test and get the print
statements rather than starting the RubyMine debugger.
</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-4">Debugger</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>For tough problems, the debugger can really help.
</li>
<li>Allows you to evaluate code and dig into variables.
</li>
<li>I'll tend to use the RubyMine debugger more for running the Rails server,
since there's no waiting for the process to start if the debugger is already
running the server.
</li>
<li>It's key to set breakpoints where you think you'll need them, start your
test, and then move your cursor to some point where the problem is
manifesting. The hit menu choice "Run -&gt; Force Run to Cursor". That is a
<b>HUGE</b> time saver.

<h2 id="sec-4">Database Cleaner</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
It's pretty critical to use Database Cleaner correctly when using Capybara with
Poltergeist. Here's my setup. The only thing specific is that I have a couple
tables that are seeded when the database is created.

</div><div id="outline-container-sec-5-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-1">AJAX</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
This is well documented on the <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara website</a>. Read the part about AJAX very
closely. The key thing is to think of what will change on the page once your
AJAX response comes back. Then use a statement like:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
expect(page).to have_content("some value")
{% endcodeblock %}
<p>
Capybara will be smart about waiting until that condition is true. However, you
have to be clever to come up with just the right condition.
</p>

<p>
Be sure to understand how <code>expect(page).to have_content("blah")</code> will poll the
page until the timeout or "blah" appears. On the contrary, <code>expect(page).to_not
have_content contain("blah")</code> will not poll! So be sure to use a positive
expectation after you take some action invoking an AJAX request (or even an
animation). Or else you may get a false positive that something is not on the
page just because the page has not finished loading.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
I'm using <a href="http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/">typeahead.js</a> with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap 3</a>, both of which rock!
</p>

<p>
Here's the secret sauce for doing capybara feature tests with the typeahead.js
auto-complete. This technique should work for other types of auto-complete as
well.
</p>

<p>
To make this work for your code, modify the <code>.tt-suggestion</code> selector depending
on how you choose to render drop downs.

Here's how you test a mouseover effect. This was recently fixed for Capybara and
Poltergeist and this absolutely rocks!

some_node = find("css selector")
some_node.hover
expect(page).to have_selector("some other css_selector")

<p>
For fun, you can put some console.log in your event handler, and run the tests,
and see in your console output that Capybara triggers the event.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
It's not perfect that I have to use <a href="https://github.com/y310/rspec-retry">rspec-retry</a> to get past random failures with
PhantomJs. However, it's way better than to let rspec simply retry before
considering the test a failure. Note, you don't to have the <code>:retry_count</code> at
anything other than 1 when you're re-running a test while developing it, as that
would really slow you down.
</p>
{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
# Discussion of retry
# https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/456
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.verbose_retry       = true # show retry status in spec process
  retry_count                = ENV['RSPEC_RETRY_COUNT']

<h2 id="sec-7">Testing with Zeus</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Overall, I'm quite pleased with the performance boost of Zeus, especially for
rake tasks, running specs, and running specs in parallel (stunning difference).
</li>
<li>It's super important to remember that you have to <b>restart Zeus</b> whenever you want
files like test.rb or spec_helper.rb (and maybe factories.rb or Gemfile) to be
re-evaluated. This can cause some very confusing results until you restart Zeus.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's my <code>zeus.json</code> file, configured to work with parallel-tests.

Every once in a while, my setup borks, and I need to kill all my zeus, guard,
phantomjs processes at once. Here's a couple useful zsh functions:
</p>
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
pgr() {
  for x in rails phantomjs zeus; do 
    pgrep -fl $x;
  done 
}

pgk() {
  for x in rails phantomjs zeus; do 
    pkill -fl $x;
  done 
}
{% endcodeblock %}

</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-8">Parallel Tests</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
As mentioned above, I got a stunning performance difference using the
<a href="https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests">parallel_tests</a> gem. However, it defaults to using as many threads as one has
processors (8 on my Macbook). Since that is too many if you want to keep using
your Mac, I use this zsh function, which defaults to 6 processors.
</p>

{% codeblock lang:bash %}
zps () {
  p=${1:-6}
  echoRun "zeus parallel_rspec -n $p spec"
}
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
The trickiest part of the parallel_tests gem is setting up and migrating the
extra test databases. Here's my rake task for doing migrations, which updates
test, development, and my parallel test databases, and annotates.
