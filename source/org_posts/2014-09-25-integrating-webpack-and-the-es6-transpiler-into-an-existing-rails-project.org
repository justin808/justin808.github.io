/There has to be a better way to incorporate the JavaScript ecosystem into Rails./

[[http://webpack.github.io/][{% img /images/2014-09-react-webpack-rails-tutorial/baby-bottle-of-gemified-javascript.jpg %}]]

*Update October, 21 2015*: We're about to release 1.0 of the [[https://rubygems.org/gems/react_on_rails][react_on_rails]] gem!
It will include a generator which will make the setup of this process super
easy!

*Update September, 28 2015*: Be sure to see
https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/ and the [[https://rubygems.org/gems/react_on_rails][gem react_on_rails]]. My team
is writing a gem to make the process of integrating react and webpack with Rails
much easier. This also supports server rendering of react components, as well as
advanced react techniques such as REDUX.

*Update August 19, 2015*: I'm working on revising this article to reflect much
progress in this area since the original publication of this article in 2014. I
highly recommend seeing the README at
https://github.com/justin808/react-webpack-rails-tutorial and the pull requests
(both [[https://github.com/justin808/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/pulls][open]] and [[https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/pulls?utf8=%25E2%259C%2593&q=is%253Apr+is%253Aclosed+][closed]]) of what's been incorporated since this article was first published.

Have you:
1. Wondered if there's a better way to utilize modern JavaScript client frameworks
   the context of an existing Ruby on Rails project?
2. Gotten confused about how to integrate JavaScript libraries and examples that
   are packaged up into proper "modules"?
3. Discovered the drawbacks of having all applications JavaScript littering the
   global name-space.
4. Heard about [[http://www.slideshare.net/domenicdenicola/es6-the-awesome-parts][ES6 (aka Harmony)]], the next version of JavaScript and how the
   cool kids in Silicon Valley (Facebook, Instagram, Square, etc.) are using ES6
   syntax?
   
How would you like to achieve, within a Rails project:
1. The ability to prototype a rich UI, seeing changes in JS and CSS/Sass code
   almost instantly after hitting save, /without the page reloading/.
2. First class citizenship for utilizing the *Node ecosystem*, by specifying
   dependencies in =package.json=, running =npm install=, and then simply requiring
   modules in JavaScript files.
3. Seamless integration of Node based JavaScript assets for the Rails Asset
   Pipeline, thus *not circumventing* the asset pipeline, but co-existing with
   it and leveraging it.
4. The ability to plug the node client side ecosystem into an existing Rails project seamlessly.
5. Utilization of many JavaScript tools, such as the *React JSX tranpiler* and *ES6 transpiler*.

This article will show you how you can utilize Webpack in your Rails development
process to achieve these goals!

#+begin_html

#+end_html

First, I'm going to tell you a brief story of how I came to the realization that
/there had to be a better way to incorporate JavaScript ecosystem into Rails/.

* What's Wrong with Copying and Pasting Tons of JavaScript into /vendor/assets/javascripts?
Imagine doing Ruby on Rails projects without [[http://bundler.io/][Bundler]]? Oh, the horror! Well
that's what copying tidbits of JavaScript into =/vendor/assets/javascripts= is
like! It's actually a bit worse than that, as many of these JavaScript libraries
depend on either [[http://requirejs.org/][AMD (aka require.js)]] or [[http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1][CommonJs module syntax]] being available.
(For a great explanation of how these module systems work, see [[http://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/][Writing Modular JavaScript With AMD, CommonJS & ES Harmony]].) This would be much more of a
problem in the Rails community were it not for the fact that many popular
JavaScript libraries are packaged into gems, such as the [[https://github.com/rails/jquery-rails][jquery-rails gem]]. You
might think that works fine, until you start to encounter JavaScript modules
that lacked Gems. For example, you may want to start leveraging the many [[https://www.npmjs.org/][npm
packaged]] react components, such as [[https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap][react-bootstrap]], or you may desire to
leverage the JavaScript toolchain, such as the [[http://facebook.github.io/react/jsx-compiler.html][JSX]] and ES6 transpilers
([[https://github.com/termi/es6-transpiler][es6-transpiler]] and [[https://github.com/esnext/es6-module-transpiler][es6-module-transpiler]]).

/Thankfully, this experience has broken me away from the JavaScript baby bottle of
gemified JavaScript! You can now become a 1st class JavaScript citizen!/
[[http://webpack.github.io/][{% img /images/2014-09-react-webpack-rails-tutorial/javascript-tourists.jpg %}]]

** Motivation: React and ES6
My foray down the Node rabbit hole began with a desire to use the React
framework, including its JSX transpiler. In a nutshell, the [[http://facebook.github.io/react/][React library]] stands
out as *unique, innovative, and impressive*. You can simply think about the
client-side UI as a set of components that are recursively composed and which
render based on set of data that flows in one direction, from the top level
component to each of its children. For further details into the benefits of
React, see my article [[http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2014/09/29/react-on-rails-4-dot-2-simple-tutorial/][React on Rails Tutorial]]. For purposes of this article, you
can imagine substituting my example of using React with your favorite rich
client JavaScript framework. /I'd be thrilled if somebody would fork my project
and create a version using [[http://emberjs.com/][EmberJs]]/.

At first this mission of integrating React seemed easy, as there is a Ruby Gem,
the [[https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails][react-rails gem]], that provided a relatively painless mechanism of
integrating react into a Rails project. This is definitely the simplest method.
I've created a tutorial, [[http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2014/09/29/react-on-rails-4-dot-2-simple-tutorial/][React on Rails Tutorial]], with a companion github
repository, [[https://github.com/justin808/react-rails-tutorial/commits/react][justin808/react-rails-tutorial]], that walks you through using the
=react-rails= gem with the [[http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#rails-generate][Rails 4.2 scaffold generator]]. Then I wanted to plug
in the [[https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap][react-bootstrap]] library. With no gem available, I considered manually
copy-pasting the source to my =/vendor/assets/javascripts= directory, but that
just seemed to /smell/ for the following reasons:
1. JavaScript has a mature system for managing dependencies (packages & modules): [[https://www.npmjs.org/][npm]] (and [[http://bower.io/][bower]]).
2. Dependencies often depend on other dependencies, in both the Ruby and
   JavaScript worlds. Imagine managing Ruby dependencies by hand.
3. JavaScript modules often depend on either CommonJs or RequireJs being
   available.

(Side note: in terms of Node, a =module= is a special case of package that
JavaScript code can =require()=. For more info, see the [[https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-faq.html][npm faq]] and [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20008442/difference-between-a-module-and-a-package-in-node][Stack Overflow]]).

Here's a good summary of other ways to handle the assets in a Rails app: [[http://www.codefellows.org/blog/five-ways-to-manage-front-end-assets-in-rails][Five Ways to Manage Front-End Assets in Rails]]. I briefly tried those techniques, plus
the [[https://github.com/hsume2/browserify-rails][browserify-rails]] gem. However, they seemed to conflict with the
=react-rails= gem, and if I didn't use that gem, I'd need a way to convert the
jsx into js files. This led me to try the webpack module bundler.

[[http://webpack.github.io/][{% img /images/2014-09-react-webpack-rails-tutorial/what-is-webpack.jpg %}]]

* Webpack
What's [[http://webpack.github.io/docs/what-is-webpack.html][Webpack]]?

#+begin_quote
webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
#+end_quote

Why did I try Webpack? It was recommended to me by [[http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/pete-hunt-react-rethinking-best-practices.html][Pete Hunt of the React team]].
Here's some solid reasons for "why Webpack":
1. Leverages npm (and optionally bower) for package management.
2. Supports whatever module syntax you prefer.
3. Has loaders (think pipeline), including ES6 and JSX.
4. Its Webpack Dev Server rocks for quick prototypes (Hot Module Replacement) of JS and
   CSS/Sass code.

A good place to get started with Webpack is Pete Hunt's [[https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto][webpack-howto]].

I initially tried the [[http://webpack.github.io/][webpack module bundler]] separate from Rails, as I wanted to
see the "hot reloading" of react code in action. You can try this sample code:
[[https://github.com/gaearon/react-tutorial-hot][react-tutorial-hot]]. [[https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack][Hot module Replacement]] changes the JS code (and possibly the
CSS) of the running code without any page refresh. Thus any data in the JS
objects sticks around! This is way cooler than [[http://livereload.com/][Live Reload]], which refreshes the
whole browser page.

Then I started using these features of Webpack:
1. [[https://github.com/shama/es6-loader][es6-loader]], which incorporates both of the [[https://github.com/termi/es6-transpiler][es6-transpiler]] and the
   [[https://github.com/esnext/es6-module-transpiler][es6-module-transpiler]]. For fun, try out the ES6 syntax with the [[http://www.es6fiddle.net/][ES6 Fiddle]].
   Here's a [[https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features][great references on ES6 features]].
2. [[https://github.com/petehunt/jsx-loader][jsx-loader]], which handles jsx files using es6.
3. Trivial integration of any additional packages available via *[[https://www.npmjs.org/][npm]]* and the
   ability to use whichever module syntax is most convenient.

As Webpack generates a "bundle" that is not necessarily minified, it would seem
that this could be incorporated into the Rails asset pipeline, and sure enough,
it can be! This is well described in this article: [[https://medium.com/brigade-engineering/setting-up-webpack-with-rails-c62aea149679][Setting Up Webpack with Rails]]
along with this example code to precompile with Webpack: [[http://www.tomdooner.com/2014/05/26/webpack.html][Webpack In The Rails Asset Pipeline]].

With the basic parts in place, I wanted achieve the following:
1. Be able to prototype client side JS using Webpack Dev Server (with hot module
   replacement), while having this same code readily available in my Rails app.
   This involves having JavaScript, Sass, and Image files commonly available to
   both Rails and the Webpack Dev Server.
2. Be able to easily deploy to Heroku.

My solution to the problem is shown in this github repo:
[[https://github.com/justin808/react-webpack-rails-tutorial][justin808/react-webpack-rails-tutorial]]. This is based on my tutorial using the
=react-rails= gem: [[https://github.com/justin808/react-rails-tutorial][Rails 4.2, React, completed tutorial]]. I will now describe
this solution in detail. 
** Setup
You'll need to install Node.js following. I'm assuming you already have Ruby and
Rails installed.
1. Node.js: You can find the [[http://nodejs.org/download/][Node.js download file here]]. Note, some friends of mine
   recommended the Node.js installer rather than using Brew. I did not try Brew.
2. Many articles recommend running the following command, so that you don't need
   to run node commands as sudo, thus changing the ownership of your /usr/local
   directory to yourself.
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local
   #+END_SRC
3. Your =/package.json= file describes all other other dependencies, and running
   =npm install= will install everything required.

Once I got this working, it felt like Santa Clause came to my app with the whole
Node ecosystem!

[[http://webpack.github.io/][{% img /images/2014-09-react-webpack-rails-tutorial/npm-webpack-presents.jpg %}]]

** Bundler and Node Package Manager
All Rails developers are familiar with gems and [[http://bundler.io/][Bundler (bundle)]]. The equivalent for
Javascript are package.json files with [[https://www.npmjs.org/][Node Package Manager (npm)]] (see
discussion in next point on why not [[http://bower.io/][Bower]]).

Both of these package manager systems take care of retreiving dependencies from
reputable online sources. Using a =package.json= file is far superior to
manually downloading dependencies and copying the =/vendor/assets/= directory!

{% img /images/2014-09-react-webpack-rails-tutorial/bundle-npm.jpg %}

** Why NPM and not Bower for JS Assets?
The most popular equivalants for JavaScript are [[https://www.npmjs.org/][Node Package Manager (npm)]] and
[[http://bower.io/][Bower]]. For use with webpack, you'll want to prefer npm, per the reasons in the
[[http://webpack.github.io/docs/usage-with-bower.html][documentation]]:

#+begin_quote
In many cases modules from npm are better than the same module from bower. Bower
mostly contain only concatenated/bundled files which are:

- More difficult to handle for webpack
- More difficult to optimize for webpack
- Sometimes only useable without a module system

So prefer to use the CommonJs-style module and let webpack build it.
#+end_quote

** Webpack Plus Rails Solution Description
To integrate webpack with Rails, webpack is used in 2 ways:
1. Webpack is used soley within the =/webpack= directory in conjunction with the
   Webpack Dev Server to provide a rapid tool for prototyping the client side
   Javascript. The file =webpack.hot.config.js= sets up the JS and CSS assets
   for the Webpack Dev Server.
2. Webpack watches for changes and generates the =rails-bundle.js= file that
   bundles all the JavaScript referenced in the =/webpack/assets/javascripts=
   directory. The file =webpack.rails.config.js= converts the JSX files into JS
   files throught the JSX and ES6 transpilers. 

The following image describes the organization of integrating Webpack with Rails.

** webpack.config
To reiterate, we needed Webpack for the following reasons:
1. To enable the use of JS "modules", using either the either the [[http://requirejs.org/][AMD (aka require.js)]] or [[http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1][CommonJs module syntax]].
2. To convert JSX files (ES6 and JSX syntax) into JS files. Note, you probably
   don't want to blindly convert all JS files into ES6, as that may conflict
   with some imported modules.

This setup with the =webpack.config= file. We need 2 versions of this file for
the two different needs, the Webpack Dev Sever and the Asset Pipeline.

{% img /images/2014-09-react-webpack-rails-tutorial/webpack-files.jpg %}

*** Changing the webpack.config
You maybe wondering if you'll need to edit these webpack config files. Here's
some things you'll need to pay attention to.

1. *module.exports.entry*: The entry points will determine what webpack places
   in the bundle. While this may seem similar to the manifest file of
   =/app/assets/javascripts/application.js=, it's very different in that you
   /only/ need to specify the */entry/* points. So if you specify
   =./assets/javascripts/example= (you don't need the file suffix) is the entry
   point, then you do not and should not specify =./assets/javascripts/CommentBox=
   as an entry point. Once again, dependencies are calculated for Webpack,
   unlike Rails.
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   module.exports = {
    context: __dirname,
    entry: [
      "./assets/javascripts/example"
    ], 
   
   #+END_SRC
2. *module.exports.externals*: If you want to load jQuery from a CDN or from the
   Rails gem, you might specify:
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   module.exports.externals: {
     jquery: "var jQuery"
   },
   #+END_SRC 
3. *module.exports.module.loaders*: This is the place where you can expose
   jQuery from your Webpack rails-bundle.js so that the rest of the non-module
   using parts of Rails can use jQuery.
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   module.exports.module: {
     loaders: [
       // Next 2 lines expose jQuery and $ to any JavaScript files loaded after rails-bundle.js
       //   in the Rails Asset Pipeline. Thus, load this one prior.
       { test: require.resolve("jquery"), loader: "expose?jQuery" },
       { test: require.resolve("jquery"), loader: "expose?$" }
     ]
   }
   #+END_SRC 

That being said, it's well worth familiarizing yourself with the [[http://webpack.github.io/docs/][documentation for webpack]]. 
The [[https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack][gitter room for webpack]] is also helpful.

** Webpack Dev Server and Hot Module Replacement
While waiting for webpack to create the rails-bundle.js file and then reloading
the Rails page is not terribly time consuming, there's *no comparison* to using
the [[http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html][Webpack Dev Server]] with [[https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack][Hot Module Replacement]] which loads new JavaScript
and Sass code without modifying the existing client side data if possible. If
you thought Live Reload was cool, you'll love this feature. To quote the
documentation:

#+begin_quote
The webpack-dev-server is a little node.js express server, which uses the
webpack-dev-middleware to serve a webpack bundle. It also has a little runtime
which is connected to the server via socket.io. The server emit information
about the compilation state to the client, which reacts on that events.

It serves static assets from the current directory. If the file isn’t found a
empty HTML page is generated whichs references the corresponding javascript
file.
#+end_quote

In a nutshell, the file =/webpack/server.js= is the http server utilizing the
[[http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html][Webpack Dev Server API]]:
1. =/webpack/webpack.hot.config.js= configures the webpack assets.
2. Has a couple of json responses.
3. Configures "hot" to be true to enable hot module replacement.
** JavaScripts
Webpack handles the following aspects of the =/webpack/assets/javascripts=
directory:
1. Preparing a "bundle" of the JavaScript files needed by either Rails or the
   Webpack Dev Server. This includes running the files through the jsx and es6
   loaders which transpile the jsx and es6 syntax into standard javascripts.
   Heres' the configuration that does the loading:
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   module.loaders = [{ test: /\.jsx$/, loaders: ["react-hot", "es6", "jsx?harmony"] }]
   #+END_SRC
2. Webpack also normalizes whichever module loading syntax you choose
   (RequireJs, CommonJs, or ES6).   
** Sass and images
For the Webpack Dev Server build (not the Rails build that creates
=rails-bundle.js=), Sass is loaded via webpack for 2 reasons:
1. Webpack takes care of running the sass compiler.
2. Any changes made to sass or css files are loaded by the hot module loader
   into the browser.
The file =/webpack/scripts/webpack_only.jsx= contains this:
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
require("test-stylesheet.css");
require("test-sass-stylesheet.scss");
#+END_SRC
This "requires" stylesheet information just like a "require" of JavaScript.
Thus, =/webpack/index.html= does not reference any output from the Sass
generation. This file, =webpack_only.jsx= is referenced only in the
=webpack.hot.config.js= file as an "entry point", which means that it gets
loaded explicitly in the created bundle file.

*Images* were a bit tricky, as during deployment, you want your images
fingerprinted for caching purposes. This is nearly invisible to users of newer
versions of the Rails, thanks to the [[http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#what-is-fingerprinting-and-why-should-i-care-questionmark][fingerprinting feature of the Rails asset pipeline]]. 
While webpack can also fingerprint images, that's not needed as we're not
depending on this feature of webpack for our Rails deployments. So we just need
the Webpack Dev Server to access the same image files. I.e., we need to be able
to use a syntax in the =scss= files to reference images that works for both the
Webpack Dev Server as well as the Rails asset pipeline.


For example, here's a snippet of sass code to load the =twitter_64.png= image
from the top level of the =/app/assets/images= directory. This needs to work for
both the Asset Pipeline as well as the Webpack Dev Server.
#+BEGIN_SRC sass
.twitter-image {
  background-image: image-url('twitter_64.png');
}
#+END_SRC

The problem of how to get the same images into the stylesheets of both Rails and
Express server versions was solved by using a *symlink*, which git will
conveniently store.
1. =/webpack/assets/images= is a symlink for the =/app/assets/images= directory.
2. The =image-url= sass helper takes care of mapping the correct directories for
   images. The image directory for the webpack server is configured by this
   line:

   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   module.loaders = [{ test: /.scss$/, loader: “style!css!sass?outputStyle=expanded&imagePath=/assets/images”}]
   #+END_SRC
   The sass gem for rails handles the mapping for the Asset Pipeline.
3. The symlink was necessary, as the Webpack Dev Server could not reference files
   above the root directory.

This way the images are signed correctly for production builds via the Rails
asset pipeline, and the images work fine for the Webpack Dev Server.

** Sourcemaps
When debugging JavaScript using the Rails app, I did not want to have to scroll
through a giant =rails-bundle.js= of all js assets. Sourcemap support in Webpack
addressed that issue. At first I tried to use plain sourcemaps (separate file
rather than integrated), but that resulted in an off by one error. Furthermore,
I had to do [[https://github.com/justin808/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/blob/3aa3cd112453ce436b942c45bb3b906458532b89/webpack/webpack.rails.config.js][some fancy work to move the created file to the correct spot]] of
=/public/assets=. Also note that building the sourcemap file when deploying to
Heroku breaks the Heroku build. Both of these cases are handled at the bottom of
the file =webpack.rails.config.js=.

This is what sourcemaps looks like in Chrome

** Heroku Deployment
There are several things needed to get builds working on Heroku.
1. It's critical that =package.json= has all tools required by the Heroku build
   in =dependencies= and /not/ =devDependencies= as Heroku only installs those
   modules in =dependencies=. You should use =devDependencies= for tools that
   *only* your local Webpack Dev Server uses.
2. Clean up your build cache:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   heroku plugins:install https://github.com/heroku/heroku-repo.git
   heroku repo:purge_cache -a <my-app> 
   #+END_SRC
3. Be sure to run npm-shrinkwrap after *ANY* changes to =dependencies= inside of
   =package.json=.
4. I needed to configure the =compile_environment= task to create the =rails-bundle.js= via
   Webpack using the file =/lib/tasks/assets.rake=.
5. Heroku needs both the node and ruby environments. In order to deploy to
   heroku, you’ll need run this command once to set a custom buildpack:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi.git
#+END_SRC

This runs the two buildpacks in the =/.buildpacks= file courtesy of the
[[https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi][ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi]] buildpack.

** Why node_modules and package.json are not in the webpack directory?
While it would be tidier to put =node_modules= and =package.json= into the
=/webpack= directory, the problem is that this would require a custom buildpack
for installing the node_modules on Heroku.
** Why Have a Second Assets Directory Under Webpack?
At first, I had Webpack reference the JSX files from the
=/app/assets/javascripts directory=. However, I wanted to be able to use a
[[http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/][WebStorm]] project just based on the JavaScript code. I'd either have to put the
WebStorm project at the root level, thus including all the Ruby directories, or
I could use a sym link to the =javascripts= directory. You *NEVER* want run two
different JetBrains products simultaneously on the same directory, so that ruled
out using WebStorm at the top of my Rails app. The symlink approach seemed to
work, but that got confusing especially given I'd sometimes open the JSX files
in Emacs.

The approach of putting the webpack bundled assets under the =/webpack/assets=
directory worked out well for me. It seems natural that Webpack bundles those
assets and puts them into the =rails-bundle.js= file in the
=/app/assets/javascripts= directory.

For the same reasons, I'm keeping style sheets referenced by Webpack under the
=/webpack= directory. Note, I'm using Webpack to load stylesheets, as that
allows the style sheet changes to be hot loaded into the browser! If you edit any
of the files in the =/webpack/assets/stylesheets= directory, you'll see the
browser update with the style changes almost immediately after you hit save. The
standard Rails file =/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss= references
the file style sheets in =/webpack/assets/stylesheets=.

** How to Add a NPM (JavaScript) module dependency?
This is a bit like modifying your Gemfile with a new gem dependency.
1. Modify your =/package.json= file with the appropriate line for the desired
   package inside the "dependencies" section. You'll want to specify an exact
   version, as that's the recommendation in the Node community. Just google "npm
   <whatever module>" and you'll get a link to the npm page for that module
   where you can see the version. For example, to add =marked= as a dependency,
   I added this line to =package.json=.
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   "marked": "^0.3.2",
   #+END_SRC
2. Include the appropriate line to require the module. For example, to include
   the =marked= library:
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   var marked = require("marked");
   #+END_SRC

** How to update Node Dependencies
When you're ready to take the time to ensure that upgrading your packages will
not break your code, you'll want to take the following steps. Refer to [[https://www.npmjs.org/package/npm-check-updates][npm-check-updates]]
and [[https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-shrinkwrap.html][npm-shrinkwrap]].
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd <top level of your app>
rm -rf node_modules
npm install -g npm-check-updates
npm-check-updates -u
npm install 
npm-shrinkwrap
#+END_SRC

* Rapid Client Development
Congratulations! You've gotten through what I believe is the secret sauce for
rapid client side JavaScript development. Once you get the setup, per the above
steps, the flow goes like this: 
1. Run the Webpack Dev Server on port 3000 
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    cd webpack && node server.js
    #+END_SRC 
2. Point your browser at [[http://0.0.0.0:3000]].
3. Start another shell and run
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    foreman start -f Procfile.dev
    #+END_SRC
4. Point your browser at [[http://0.0.0.0:4000]] and verify you can see the usage of
   the rails-bundle.js file.
5. Update the =jsx= and =scss= files under =/webpack/assets= and see the browser
   at port 3000 update when files are saved.
6. Start with static data in the JSX creation, and then move to having the
   =server.js= file vend JSON to the client.
7. Once that works, have the rails server create the JSON.
8. Deploy to Heroku!
9. Prosper!
