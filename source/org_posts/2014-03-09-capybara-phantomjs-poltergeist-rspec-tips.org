I've added a page of [[http://www.railsonmaui.com/tips/rails/capybara-phantomjs-poltergeist-rspec-rails-tips.html][tips on integration (aka feature spec) testing using Capybara, PhantomJs,
Poltergeist, and Rspec]].

Some of the tips include:
1. Favorite test configuration (gems, spec_helper, etc.) for feature specs.
2. How to troubleshoot and debug feature specs
3. My setup for using Zeus with parallel-tests, including a rake task for
   setting up the databases.
4. Tricky testing:
   1) Auto-complete dropdowns (some handy utility methods).
   2) Hover effects (easy now!)
   3) AJAX

I'll try to keep this page of tips updated as my test configuration evolves.
