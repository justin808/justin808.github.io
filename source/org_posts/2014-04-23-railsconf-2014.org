* (Lack of) Live Coding in my Talk
Due to time constraints, I chose to skip the live coding I had prepared to do in
my talk. [[emailto:justin@railsonmaui.com][Please let me know]] if you'd be interested in a screencast walking
through the sample code. I will create one if there is sufficient demand.
