A couple weeks ago, I wrote a popular article, [[http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2014/08/17/pry-ruby-and-fun-with-the-hash-constructor/][Pry, Ruby, and Fun With the Hash Constructor]] demonstrating the usefulness of
[[https://github.com/pry/pry][pry]] with the [[http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Hash.html][Hash bracket constructor]]. I just ran into a super fun test example of pry
that I couldn't resist sharing!

* The Task: Convert CSV File without Headers to Array of Hashes

For example, you want to take a csv file like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
|---+--------+--------|
| 1 | Justin | Gordon |
| 2 | Tender | Love   |
|---+--------+--------|
#+END_EXAMPLE

And create an array of hashes like this with column headers "id", "first_name", "last_name":
#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
[
    [0] {
               "id," => "1",
        "first_name" => "Justin",
         "last_name" => "Gordon"
    },
    [1] {
               "id," => "2",
        "first_name" => "Tender",
         "last_name" => "Love"
    }
]
#+END_SRC

You'd think that you could just pass the headers to the =CSV.parse=, but that
doesn't work:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
[11] (pry) main: 0> col_headers = %w(id, first_name last_name)
[
    [0] "id,",
    [1] "first_name",
    [2] "last_name"
]
[12] (pry) main: 0> csv = CSV.parse(csv_string, headers: col_headers)
(pry) output error: #<NoMethodError: undefined method `table' for #<Object:0x007fdbfc8d5588>>
#+END_SRC

#+begin_html
<!-- more -->
#+end_html

* Using Array#zip

I stumbled upon a note about the CSV parser that suggested using =Array#zip= to
add keys to the results created by the CSV parser when headers don't exist in
the file.

Using =Array#zip=? What the heck is the =zip= method? Compression?

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
[1] (pry) main: 0> ? a_array.zip

From: array.c (C Method):
Owner: Array
Visibility: public
Signature: zip(*arg1)
Number of lines: 17

Converts any arguments to arrays, then merges elements of self with
corresponding elements from each argument.

This generates a sequence of ary.size _n_-element arrays,
where _n_ is one more than the count of arguments.

If the size of any argument is less than the size of the initial array,
nil values are supplied.

If a block is given, it is invoked for each output array, otherwise an
array of arrays is returned.

   a = [ 4, 5, 6 ]
   b = [ 7, 8, 9 ]
   [1, 2, 3].zip(a, b)   #=> [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
   [1, 2].zip(a, b)      #=> [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8]]
   a.zip([1, 2], [8])    #=> [[4, 1, 8], [5, 2, nil], [6, nil, nil]]
#+END_SRC

Hmmmm....Why would that be useful?

Here's some pry command that demonstrate this. I encourage you to follow along
in pry!

I first created a CSV string from hand like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
[2] (pry) main: 0> csv_file = <<-CSV
[2] (pry) main: 0* 1, "Justin", "Gordon"
[2] (pry) main: 0* 2, "Avdi", "Grimm"
[2] (pry) main: 0* CSV
"1, \"Justin\", \"Gordon\"\n2, \"Avdi\", \"Grimm\"\n"
[3] (pry) main: 0> CSV.parse(csv_file) { |csv_row| p csv_row }
CSV::MalformedCSVError: Illegal quoting in line 1.
from /Users/justin/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.2/lib/ruby/2.1.0/csv.rb:1855:in `block (2 levels) in shift'
#+END_SRC

Doooh!!!! That taught me that creating a legit CSV string is not as easy as it sounds.

Let's create a legit csv string:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
[4] (pry) main: 0> csv_string = CSV.generate do |csv|
[4] (pry) main: 0*   csv << [1, "Justin", "Gordon"]
[4] (pry) main: 0*   csv << [2, "Tender", "Love"]
[4] (pry) main: 0* end
"1,Justin,Gordon\n2,Tender,Love\n"
#+END_SRC

Notice, there's no quotes around the single word names!

If I use CSV to parse this, we get the reverse result, the array of arrays,
back:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
[16] (pry) main: 0> CSV.parse(csv_string)
[
    [0] [
        [0] "1",
        [1] "Justin",
        [2] "Gordon"
    ],
    [1] [
        [0] "2",
        [1] "Tender",
        [2] "Love"
    ]
]
[17] (pry) main: 0> CSV.parse(csv_string).class
Array < Object
#+END_SRC

Ahh...Could we use the Hash[] constructor to convert these arrays into Hashes
that place the proper keys?

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
[18] (pry) main: 0> first_row = CSV.parse(csv_string).first
[
    [0] "1",
    [1] "Justin",
    [2] "Gordon"
]
[19] (pry) main: 0> col_headers = %w(id, first_name last_name)
[
    [0] "id,",
    [1] "first_name",
    [2] "last_name"
]
[20] (pry) main: 0> first_row.zip(col_headers)
[
    [0] [
        [0] "1",
        [1] "id,"
    ],
    [1] [
        [0] "Justin",
        [1] "first_name"
    ],
    [2] [
        [0] "Gordon",
        [1] "last_name"
    ]
]
[21] (pry) main: 0> Hash[ first_row.zip(col_headers) ]
{
         "1" => "id,",
    "Justin" => "first_name",
    "Gordon" => "last_name"
}
#+END_SRC

Bingo!

Now, let's fix the array of arrays, creating an array called =rows= 

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
[22] (pry) main: 0> rows = CSV.parse(csv_string)
[
    [0] [
        [0] "1",
        [1] "Justin",
        [2] "Gordon"
    ],
    [1] [
        [0] "2",
        [1] "Tender",
        [2] "Love"
    ]
]
#+END_SRC

Then the grand finale!
#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
[24] (pry) main: 0> rows.map { |row| Hash[ col_headers.zip(row) ] }
[
    [0] {
               "id," => "1",
        "first_name" => "Justin",
         "last_name" => "Gordon"
    },
    [1] {
               "id," => "2",
        "first_name" => "Tender",
         "last_name" => "Love"
    }
]
#+END_SRC

And sure, you can do this all on one line by inlining the =rows= variable:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
CSV.parse(csv_string).map { |row| Hash[ col_headers.zip(row) ] }
#+END_SRC

* Using headers option in CSV?
Well, you'd think that you could just pass the headers to the =CSV.parse=, but
that doesn't work:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
[12] (pry) main: 0> csv = CSV.parse(csv_string, headers: col_headers)
(pry) output error: #<NoMethodError: undefined method `table' for #<Object:0x007fdbfc8d5588>>
#+END_SRC

Well, what's the doc?

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
[13] (pry) main: 0> ? CSV.parse

From: /Users/justin/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.2/lib/ruby/2.1.0/csv.rb @ line 1278:
Owner: #<Class:CSV>
Visibility: public
Signature: parse(*args, &block)
Number of lines: 11

:call-seq:
  parse( str, options = Hash.new ) { |row| ... }
  parse( str, options = Hash.new )

This method can be used to easily parse CSV out of a String.  You may either
provide a block which will be called with each row of the String in turn,
or just use the returned Array of Arrays (when no block is given).

You pass your str to read from, and an optional options Hash containing
anything CSV::new() understands.
#+END_SRC

Hmmm...seems that passing the =headers= should have worked.

The [[http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.2/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html#method-c-new][CSV docs clearly state]] that the initialize method takes an option =:headers=

#+begin_quote
:headers
If set to :first_row or true, the initial row of the CSV file will be treated as
a row of headers. If set to an Array, the contents will be used as the headers.
If set to a String, the String is run through a call of ::parse_line with the
same :col_sep, :row_sep, and :quote_char as this instance to produce an Array of
headers. This setting causes #shift to return rows as CSV::Row objects instead
of Arrays and #read to return CSV::Table objects instead of an Array of Arrays.
#+end_quote

So, what can we call on a new CSV object? Let's list the methods.

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
[25] (pry) main: 0> ls CSV.new(csv_string, headers: col_headers)
Enumerable#methods:

  @encoding    @header_converters  @lineno   @quote_char  @return_headers  @skip_lines   @write_headers
#+END_SRC

How about this:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
[14] (pry) main: 0> csv = CSV.new(csv_string, headers: col_headers).to_a
[
    [0] #<CSV::Row "id,":"1" "first_name":"Justin" "last_name":"Gordon">,
    [1] #<CSV::Row "id,":"2" "first_name":"Tender" "last_name":"Love">
]
#+END_SRC

Well, that's getting closer.

How about if I just map those rows with a =to_hash=?
#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
[16] (pry) main: 0> csv = CSV.new(csv_string, headers: col_headers).map(&:to_hash)
[
    [0] {
               "id," => "1",
        "first_name" => "Justin",
         "last_name" => "Gordon"
    },
    [1] {
               "id," => "2",
        "first_name" => "Tender",
         "last_name" => "Love"
    }
]
#+END_SRC

Bingo!

I hope you enjoyed this!
