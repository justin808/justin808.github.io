/Note: This is a refresh of my original post from April, 2013 to adjust for Emacs 24.3 and org-mode 8.2.x/

WordPress seemed like a good blogging platform, but it just didn't feel right. I
spend all my day editing text files using vim key-bindings, and I love [[http://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]]
for all non-coding writing. If you don't know Org Mode, it's like having
Markdown mode on steroids. You can have a numbered list in Markdown, but
org-mode lets you re-order the list, and that's just the beginning. Editing blog
documents in the WordPress editor felt almost as bad as being told to use MS
Word. I found that ergonomics of Org Mode, including all the goodness of recent
versions of [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], including [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil][Evil]] (Vim emulation), just made organization of
creative thoughts so much more enjoyable.

So I bit the bullet one weekend, and dove into [[http://octopress.org/][Octopress]], publishing my first
article, [[http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/04/27/octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/][Octopress Setup with Github, Org Mode, and LiveReload]]. The solution
presented in that article [[http://blog.paphus.com/blog/2012/08/01/introducing-octopress-blogging-for-org-mode/][Introducing Octopress Blogging for Org-Mode]] stopped
working when I upgraded Emacs to 24.3 and org-mode to 8.2.x. Here's a rehash of
my original article updated to the latest software versions as of March, 2014.

If you used to writing real web applications, rather than know the intricacies
of a giant monolithic blogging platform, then the [[http://octopress.org/docs/theme/template/][customization of Octopress]]
seems so much more straightforward. This is so much more like the Unix
philosophy that so many of us love, which is small and modular, rather than
monolithic.

I like [[https://github.com/robdodson/robdodson.github.com/blob/source/source/_posts/2012-04-30-custom-domain-with-octopress-and-github-pages.markdown][Rob Dodson's summary]] (noting Org Mode plus Emacs):

- [[http://octopress.org/][Octopress]] is a blogging framework written by [[http://brandonmathis.com/][Brandon Mathis]] ([[https://twitter.com/#!/imathis][@imathis]]) which
  sits on top of [[https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll][Jekyll]]. Jekyll is a static site generator, meaning there's no
  database associated with your blog. Instead of writing everything in a WSYWIG
  linked to MySQL (like Wordpress or Blogger) you produce text files using
  Markdown which are then converted to static HTML. There are 3 huge benefits to
  this approach. First, writing in Markdown (*org-mode* for me) is awesome. Once
  you learn the syntax it's incredibly fast and you don't have to spend time
  playing with a tiny little editor window just to add /some/ *style* to your
  posts. Second, writing in your favorite text editor is also awesome. I produce
  everything in Sublime Text 2 (*Emacs* for me) and every day I discover new
  tricks to make the process better. If you've ever had to write a blog post
  using one of those horrible little TinyMCE editors you will appreciate this
  feature. And lastly, static HTML is *fast*.

This article should be useful for:
  1. Any interest in using org-mode to publish to Octopress including some
     reasons I use Org Mode (with Emacs).
  2. Some explanation of what Octopress and git are doing.
  3. Anybody curious about how using free github pages works to host Octopress.

Incidentally, since my blog is hosted using github pages, the source code and
configuration I use to generate it can all be found [[https://github.com/justin808/justin808.github.io][here]]. See the notes below on
the difference between the =source= and =master= branches.

* Basic setup
1. [[http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/04/30/custom-domain-with-octopress-and-github-pages/][Rob Dodson on Octopress]]: Start off with these instructions from this posting
   on April 30th, 2012. There are a few differences worth noting:
   1. You should change the .rvmrc to a .ruby-version file
   2. Github recommends your deployment repository be named =yourname.github.io=,
      not =yourname.github.com=.
   3. After you run =rake setup_github_pages= and before running =rake
      generate=, you should run =rake install=. If you forget, there's a clear
      message indicating this omission.
2. Customize =octopress/_config.yml=. The yaml file contains descriptions.
3. Update the DNS to use your custom domain if you wish: [[https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages][Github directions on
   setting up a custom domain]]
4. At this point, you can create a post:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rake new_post["my post name"]
  #+END_SRC

  Create a page:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rake new_page["my page name"]
  #+END_SRC

  Generate and deploy:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rake gen_deploy
  #+END_SRC

  Watch the site and regenerate when it changes:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rake watch
  #+END_SRC

  Preview the site in a web browser:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rake preview
  #+END_SRC

  See all the available rake options:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rake -T
  #+END_SRC

  Save changes to source branch:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "save changes to source"
  git push origin source
  #+END_SRC

* Some Perspectives on how Octopress Works
** Posts
*Posts* are created using the rake task =rake new_post["Post Title"]=. The key things about a post are:
1. File is located in =source/_posts.
2. File has a header containing the meta-data for the post. The post URL and
   date are determined by the by the =title= and =date= fields. If you want to
   change the date of your post, then you change the meta-data. Changing the
   file name is useful only for file navigation. Here's a [[https://gist.github.com/justin808/5550381][gist for a rake task
   to update the file names to match the metadata]].

** Pages
*Pages* are created using the rake task =rake new_page["Page Title"]=. The key
things about a page are:
1. Files are located in =source/page-title=
2. File has a header containing the meta-data for the post.

I use "Pages" for things like [[http://www.railsonmaui.com/about][my "about" page.]]

* POW
POW allows you to point your browser to =http://octopress.dev= to see your local,
unpublished Octopress website. It's very convenient to not have to remember to
run a local server, and it works great with LiveReload. Scroll to the bottom of
this link for details on [[http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/][POW]]. The alternative to running POW is to run =rake
preview= and then point your browser at =http://0.0.0.0:4000= (or whatever port
you configured).

* Automatically Generating the Site
Start a shell tab running this command: =rake generate && rake watch=. Edit a
file in markdown or follow the instructions below to use org-mode.

* Org-Mode
You can skip this section if you're not interested in org-mode. However, it's
super cool!
** Why org-mode for blog publishing?
[[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] offers quite a bit more than plain markdown. It's quite the *hacker's
delight* for note taking and authoring of blog articles. Down below I list a few
reasons why org-mode. Here's a few org-mode features I love (Some are Emacs
ones):
1. All headers and list items can be reordered with minimal keystrokes (think
   super powerful outliner).
2. Numbered lists.
3. Editable tables in text editor, with movable columns, movable rows.
4. Ergonomics of insertion of URLs and images.
5. Includes the basics of markdown, such as source code blocks and much more.

** Org-mode Integration
The [[https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress][org-octopress]] plugin automates the process of converting an org-mode
document (=.org= file) in =source/org_posts= into a =.html= document in
=source/_posts=. Once the html document is saved in _posts, the =rake watch=
task picks up the change and deploys the file. *Neat!*

Here are the basic steps:
1. Install Emacs 24.3 and use the package manager to install org-mode and
   [[https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress][org-octopress]].
2. See my Emacs configuration below.
3. Note, there are two ways to use org-octopress. I do not use its features to
   automate the setup of the directories. This automated setup does not provide
   a way to have "pages". As of March, 2014, you can only have "posts". Instead,
   my configuration below handles the mapping of directories.
4. +Images work fine.+ Well, almost fine. The big gotcha is that the standard
   inclusion of images in org-mode results in broken paths at deployment. The
   workaround is to embed the [[http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/image-tag/][Octopress syntax for an image]], and to place the
   images under source/images. Note, you'll want to be sure to use an absolute
   path, or else your article might look OK on the home page, but might now work
   in the postings directory. If I'm creating a document with many images, I'll
   group the images for that document in a sub-directory of images named like
   the document. This is how it should look. The trick is to place the
   octopress =img= directive within a HTML begin/end block.

   {% img /images/2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/org-mode-images.png %}
5. *Links*: This is key thing to get right. It's critical to understand the
   issues links, or else you'll have one of these issues:
   1. Links work when you test your blog locally using =pow=, but not when you
      go to your published website. This happens if you use a relative link from
      blog articles, because blog articles sometimes appear on your home page
      and sometimes under the =/blog= directory. You have to use your domain
      address to link from blog articles to other articles on your blog.
   2. You'd like your local links to point to the correct local spot. You can do
      this for links on static pages, but just not blog articles. Thus, for
      non-blog articles, it's preferable to use the =file:= relative path format
      (just not =file:/= absolute path and not =file:~/=).
   *Here's the rules:*
    
   Links from static pages, relatively specified to other static pages and to
   posts. Ensure that there's no =/= immediately following =file:=. For example:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   [[file:telecommuting.html][Why telecommuting works and how I maximize productivity]]
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   Or if the link is one level under the current directory:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   [[file:misc/telecommuting.html][Why telecommuting works and how I maximize productivity]]
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   Links from a /page/ to a /post/ can use a relative link like this.
   /Important: you must use the =YYYY/MM/DD/blog-title/index.html= format! and you must specify the article title./
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   [[file:../blog/2013/04/27/octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/index.html][Org-Mode Octopress Setup V2]]
   #+END_EXAMPLE 
   *However*, links from posts to other posts require an absolute URL using your
   published domain name. The big gotcha is that blog posts sometimes are shown
   on the home page and sometimes inside of the blog directory. To avoid
   trouble, you need to follow a format as this example shows. It's easiest to
   copy the URL from the browser address bar.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   [[http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/05/08/strategies-for-rails-logging-and-error-handling/][Strategies for Rails Logging and Error Handling]]
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   I tried using a =file:../blog= syntax, but that either would work on the home
   page or in the specific blog article, but not both. =http:/blog= links would
   work in Chrome but not mobile Safari. Hopefully, one day we'll be able to
   specify relative links from blog article to blog article. /For now, this is a
   big *gotcha*./
   *Tip*: You can specify relative links between org pages using the =.org= file
   suffix, rather than html. The earlier example could have been specified as:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   [[file:misc/telecommuting.org][Why telecommuting works and how I maximize productivity]]
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   That allows you to put your cursor on the link in emacs, and hit F12 to go
   the org file! I've got =F12= mapped to =org-open-at-point=. Awesome!
6. Bold and italic styling (text inside of stars and /) was a bit of mystery
   using the standard theme. Octopress has styling for =<strong>= and =<em>=. Org-mode spits out =<b>= and
   =<i>= tags.
   Add this to =sass/custom/_fonts.scss=.
   #+BEGIN_SRC css sass/custom/_fonts.scss
   b { font-weight: bold; }
   i { font-style: italic; }
   #+END_SRC

   Code styling (text inside of equals) =like this= did not work after a code block unless I added
   the =div= tag to this line around 100 in =_syntax.scss=. You're just adding
   the =div= selector.
   #+BEGIN_SRC css
   // Sometimes html gen by org-mode misses p or li tags, so add div to the mix
   div, p, li {
     code {
       @extend .mono;
   #+END_SRC

   
* Useful Scripts
+ Just configure =OCTO_HOME=
+ Emacs tip: Visit the created file by placing cursor over file name and then hit =Ctrl-x, f=.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
export OCTO_HOME=~/octopress
ogen () {
  cd $OCTO_HOME; rake generate; cd -
}

osave () {
  cd $OCTO_HOME; git commit -am "Updates" && git push origin source; cd -
}

odeploy () {
  cd $OCTO_HOME; osave; rake gen_deploy; cd -
}

# this one is for orgmode only
opost() {
  cd $OCTO_HOME
  output=$(rake new_post["${1}"])
  new_file=$(echo $output | awk '{print $4}')
  base=$(basename $new_file)
  new_location=$OCTO_HOME/source/org_posts/
  mv $OCTO_HOME/$new_file $new_location
  echo created $new_location/$base
  cd -
}

opage() {
  cd $OCTO_HOME
  rake new_page["${1}"]
  cd -
}

* Deploying to Github: Directory Structure of Octopress and the master and source Git Branches
Github offers free hosting of both the blog deployment and source. You're
looking at the deployment right now. You can find the source here at
[[https://github.com/justin808/justin808.github.io][my git repo justin808.github.io]]. I doubt you could beat the price, performance, and
convenience. You can look inside of this repo, clone it, etc. and you have
everything that it took to make this blog.

I originally was quite confused by the concept of using two separate git
branches to make up what gets deployed on the live website versus the git
repository of my articles. Plus, there's the issue of Octopress git repository
that you clone when starting out. Eventually, I figured out that the two branches
simply contain different files, with one containing the original Octopress
files. Here's a few screen grabs that might clarify the situation for you.

Don't forget that you never push to the master branch, but rather the =rake
deploy= task does it for you. Instead, you run =git push origin source= to push
the content of your blog to github.

The =octopress/public= directory corresponds to what you'll find on the github
site for your deployment (master branch).

{% img /images/2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/public-dir-corresponds-master-branch.png %}

The octopress/.gitignore file contains entries like =public=, which essentially
keeps the =rake generate= files out of the source branch.

Here's the github master branch right after creation. Note the correspondence
with =public=. This is what gets deployed as your blog.
{% img /images/2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/github-master-branch.png %}

Here's the github source branch. This contains the octopress environment, as
well as your customizations and blog posts.

* Live Reload
Previously, I tried to get Live Reload to work. It would be neat it worked, but
I ran into a snag. The browser gets triggered to update before the Jekyll page
is generated. I tried some various techniques for working around this, but
nothing seemed reliable. If you figure out how to fix this, please let me know.
