I updated my previous post [[http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2013/05/26/ember-dot-js-hello-world/][Ember.js Hello World]] with a video walkthrough of the
[[https://github.com/justin808/ember-js-guides-railsonmaui-no-rest][completed code found on github]] of the [[http://emberjs.com/guides/][Tom Dale's Intro Tutorial Video]] on
EmberJs.

Ember is really gaining some traction. For example, [[http://boingboing.net/][boing boing]] just moved it's
comments to Discourse, which is based on EmberJs. You can read about it at
boing boing: [[http://boingboing.net/2013/06/27/can-we-talk.html][Can we talk?]].

Please let me know if this walkthrough is helpful. Comments are always welcome.
